        <p class="chapter-desc">March 25, 2018</p>

        <p><span class="versal versal-a">A</span> curious side-track of the story began on March 25.</p>
        <p>Narcolept received a message from the puppeteer, which said just &ldquo;... For far too long to it we bowed,&rdquo;. Shortly after, Kallah had gotten &ldquo;. The wheel is turning, my dear crowd!&rdquo;. By then it was fairly obvious that this would be another poem, only sent in a very disjointed way.</p>
        <p>The notion was furthered when WeHaveLifdoff received &ldquo;.... its time had passed so long agone&rdquo;. The question arose - how to arrange the lines so that it makes the original poem? The first proposed variant:</p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">For far too long to it we bowed,
            <br>.
            <br>The wheel is turning, my dear crowd!
            <br>its time has passed so long agone.</p>
        <p>That is because the Puppeteer&rsquo;s poems were always (well, aside perhaps from some very early ones) written in ABAB format. Therefore the lines Kallah and Narc had received would have another line in-between them.</p>
        <p>Initial proposition was rebuffed due to last two lines not working together grammatically. Therefore, a second one was made:</p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">The wheel is turning, my dear crowd!
            <br>.
            <br>For far too long to it we bowed,
            <br>its time has passed so long agone.</p>
        <p>This felt better, and the what remained was to get the missing line. Tikaro had gotten &ldquo;.. Great Sin with you we shall dethrone!&rdquo; shortly after, thusly completing poem <span class="tooltip">#86<span class="tooltiptext ref86"></span></span>. As you can see, the saved poem differs from the second proposal. In hindsight, the periods in the beginnings of the lines likely refer to their place in the poem as intended by the Puppeteer. But we have decided that the order in which <span class="tooltip">#86<span class="tooltiptext ref86"></span></span> is saved sounded more naturally.</p>
        <p>The fairly straightforward poem is again referencing advancements within the Father&rsquo;s plan to kill the Great Old Sin (Soul of Cinders) and lift its oppressive influence from the world. We are also witnessing more references to the Sin, as we are coming closer to the final big event of the story.</p>
        <p>Shortly after we have settled on the order in which to save the poem, a most peculiar image was sent to every discord channel, as well as to many members in private messages (<span class="tooltip">#87<span class="tooltiptext ref87"></span></span>):</p>

        <img src="assets/images/180325_encryption_big0.png"  data-action="zoom"/>

        <p>An encoding! That much was obvious immediately, but what exactly was encoded, and how to get it out? Best way to go about it was to analyze the initial image and see how much information we could get. Beware, this will get technical.</p>
        <p>The full dimensions were 32px by 100px. It consisted of two long 16px wide and 76px tall strips and two hints at the bottom. The left stripe was colored, the right one had only transparent and black pixels. First hint has shown pure RGBA colors transforming into pure white pixels. Second hint seemingly swapped 0s and 1s around.</p>
        <p>From this much we could gather that the information encoded could have been in binary (due to the second hint). Moreover, Puppeteer has been fond of using binary in his poems for numbering. The initial idea was to simply bucket fill all colored pixels with white, as well as all transparent. This yielded nothing of worth.</p>
        <p>What followed was a series of what could be amounted to blind guessing. We have tried various permutations of bucket filling different colors with white or black in the left strip, and overlaying the right strip on it afterwards. Some results gave rise to interesting patterns, others just looked like white noise.</p>
        <p>The analysis continued with realization that the colors on the left strip were 100% pure, with no semitones used. Colors used were all the permutations of 255 red, 155 green, 255 blue that could be made.</p>
        <p>Early on in our decrypting pursuit we have realized that we were in need of some way to check our results. Manipulating the image was easy, but how to extract information from it? Alex had suggested a straightforward binary to ASCII text converter. But first, we needed to convert the image itself into binary. This is not a difficult problem - just map black pixels to 0, white pixels to 1. But with at least a 16x72 image, that&rsquo;s a lot of manual typing to do. We weren&rsquo;t going to do that, and instead used an online converter we had quickly found (https://www.dcode.fr/binary-image). </p>
        <p>Next question was how to map a 2D pixel image onto a 1D line of bits. The most conventional way would be to read it like a book: left-to-right, top-to-bottom. This is the way we had decided to do it.</p>
        <p>Unsuccessful in our previous attempts, we tried separating the RGB channels from each other. In hindsight this was the right way to go about it, but we had not realized that for a fair while longer.</p>

        <p>The first day of decoding was unsuccessful, and we went on.</p>
        <p>On the second day, Ensign Epic had received an additional encoding from the Puppeteer (<span class="tooltip">#88<span class="tooltiptext ref88"></span></span>):</p>

        <img src="assets/images/180325_encryption_big1.png" data-action="zoom"/>

        <p>This one a fair bit smaller and had just two 16x16 black and white squares on it. It was cracked almost immediately, and revealed a simple message: <code>L O S E N O T A S I N G L E B I T</code>. This has proven to be an important find, as it had confirmed what we were suspecting: the information that was encoded was ascii text in binary format, later encoded as pixels. 0s mapped to blacks, 1s to whites.</p>
        <p>In parallel to this, Fanboy had sent the Puppeteer a fairly large poem, highly praising all of his work:</p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">Pardon my rudeness, as thine request
            <br>I did not see in time - a shame
            <br>Too tired I was - had to rest
            <br>resulting in a showing lame
            <br>
            <br>Each time you&rsquo;ve offered bouts of skill
            <br>amusement to those bound by death
            <br>A chance to show our Ashen Will
            <br>and fight until one draws no breath
            <br>
            <br>The shows you put on - they amaze
            <br>all of the times that I&rsquo;ve observed
            <br>Impossible, it is to turn ones gaze:
            <br>Indeed you have your praise deserved!
            <br>
            <br>A cryptic image we&rsquo;ve received
            <br>a work of yours to test our mind
            <br>Prevail we will, won&rsquo;t be deceived,
            <br>and find we shall the puppet-kind!</p>
        <p>As a response, the Puppeteer had sent him the same small encryption he sent to Ensign, along with poem <span class="tooltip">#89<span class="tooltiptext ref89"></span></span>. The former half had thanked Fanboy for the praise and the fact that it was sent in poems. The latter gave more lore on the state of the world - a dominant theme of this period of the story.</p>
        <p>Additional encoding has spurred up more discussions about what we could do with the main one, and it almost seemed like we understood how to find the solution now. But the problem of converting colored parts to white still remained.</p>
        <p>Next followed the ideas about separating the colors out, and trying to manipulate them in some way. Unsuccessful, we took another look at the additional encoding.</p>
        <p>Narcolept had quickly converted one line of a poem into binary, hoping to see some sort of a pattern in the bits:</p>
        <code>01000110 01101111
            01110010 00100000
            01100110 01100001
            01110010 00100000
            01110100 01101111
            01101111 00100000
            01101100 01101111
            01101110 01100111
            00100000 01110100
            01101111 00100000
            01101001 01110100
            00100000 01110111
            01100101 00100000
            01100010 01101111
            01110111 01100101
            01100100 00101100</code>
        <p>And pattern we did see - a single character (which is represented by 8 bits, so 01010000 for example is &ldquo;P&rdquo;) never had a 1 as its left-most bit. This meant that we would expect to see long vertical black stripes on the correctly decoded image.</p>

        <p>More unsuccessful brainstorming ensued. The progress was made in face of the idea that we would expect long black stripes to appear on a good image. Still, the encoding remained uncracked.</p>
        <p>Next day, Terrid had received yet another small encoding, with the Puppeteer slowly nudging us towards the right solution (<span class="tooltip">#90<span class="tooltiptext ref90"></span></span>, left half):</p>

        <img src="assets/images/180325_encryption_big2.png" data-action="zoom"/>

        <p>What some had thought to be a smaller version of the main code, was in fact a completely new message. This is also the time we finally made a separate discord channel for the Puppeteer&rsquo;s story, back then mostly a way to not flood other channels with our attempts at decoding the main image.</p>
        <p>Yet more analysis came forth, with us trying to do everything we did with the main encoding, but on this small one. The encoding held steadfast. We would get to the bottom of it soon, but first, another event followed...</p>
