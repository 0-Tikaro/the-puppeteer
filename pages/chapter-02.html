            <p><span class="versal versal-r">R</span>edflame Erik&rsquo;s sign was found near the Keep Perimeter bonfire by Vulc, who was doing a Dried Finger run. Erik kept trailing the run and switching between putting down a red sign and using his own Dried Finger to pull some active invaders towards him. He also was summoning people that were putting their mad signs down. Alex has recorded one of his short encounters with Erik:</p>

            <span class="video" data-id="180120_0"></span>

            <p>After some time passed, Alex received poem <span class="tooltip">#3<span class="tooltiptext ref3"></span></span>, stating that he will remain embered in Demon Ruins. Later, Puppeteer sent <span class="tooltip">#4<span class="tooltiptext ref4"></span></span> to Narcolept. This poem is more interesting than the previous ones, as it references the origin of the four original puppets. They seem to have originally been dead\hollowed out (as they &ldquo;slumbered in the dirt&rdquo;). The Father, thus, had reanimated them via unknown means. During the fights with Discord members, their past experience as warriors had also been restored (&ldquo;In battle you have made them thrive.&rdquo;). Narcolept has also recorded several fights with Erik:</p>

            <span class="video" data-id="180120_1"></span>

            <p>The Puppeteer sent Alex poem <span class="tooltip">#5<span class="tooltiptext ref5"></span></span> after a little bit. This one said that Redflame Erik is satisfied, and that other puppets will take his place now. The second verse refers to each puppet of the original roster:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>"From faraway has traveled first" is the most cryptic one. It seems to be a foreshadowing of Heart of Spears, but he is also not from the original roster of four.</li>
                <li>"Second&rsquo;s but a phantom ripple" refers to White Vagrant, who appears to be a white spirit that has lost the connection to its original world, akin to Vagrants from DS1.</li>
                <li>"Third of Abyss" is Lone Darkwraith, as all Darkwraiths have a strong connection to the Abyss.</li>
                <li>"Next of a flaming thirst"&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;Redflame Erik.
                <li>"The last is but an armless cripple"&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;the least cryptic one of references. This is Oden the Armless.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>Lastly, this poem also has a binary counter at the end. This is most likely to show in which order the following poems should be read.</p>
            <p>Oden the Armless began invading. During this segment the Steam name of the Puppeteer was figured out to be &ldquo;__t_he_pu_ppete_er&rdquo; (this is also the first time the name &ldquo;Puppeteer&rdquo; was used). As the event progressed, Lone Darkwraith and White Vagrant followed. Narcolept received poem <span class="tooltip">#6<span class="tooltiptext ref6"></span></span>, which talked about all of the puppets now having to be repaired, as they continuously &ldquo;fell from blades you wield&rdquo;. Poem <span class="tooltip">#7<span class="tooltiptext ref7"></span></span>, which would be sent a bit later, continues the ideas started in <span class="tooltip">#4<span class="tooltiptext ref4"></span></span> about the origin of the puppets.</p>
            <p>Narcolept also recorded a bunch of his fights with the Puppeteer during this event:</p>

            <span class="video" data-id="180120_2"></span>
            <span class="video" data-id="180120_3"></span>

            <p>After killing White Vagrant all the way up in Irithyll, Paprika was sent poem <span class="tooltip">#8<span class="tooltiptext ref8"></span></span>. This is the first poem to talk about Father&rsquo;s main goal&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;to &ldquo;kill the Flame, the god of all&rdquo;. This is the Soul of Cinder, also known as &ldquo;Great Old Sin&rdquo;. The next time it will be brought up will be only in <span class="tooltip">#61<span class="tooltiptext ref61"></span></span>, more than a month in the future from this point.</p>
            <p>The event finished with Jean getting poem <span class="tooltip">#9<span class="tooltiptext ref9"></span></span>, which was a continuation of <span class="tooltip">#6<span class="tooltiptext ref6"></span></span> in that the puppets have all sustained considerable damage, and repairs were now in order. Starting from this point onwards, the Puppeteer&rsquo;s game will continue for almost four months, ending at May 14th.</p>
