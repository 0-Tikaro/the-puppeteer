        <p class="chapter-desc">March 12â€“18, 2018</p>

        <p><span class="versal versal-w">W</span>ith the Nameless Flame gone, we were starting to wonder what puppets we would encounter next. The only active one left was Heart of Spears. Would there be new puppets coming in?</p>
        <p>The Puppeteer had a plan. In the duration of a week starting on March 12 we have received lines <span class="tooltip">#71<span class="tooltiptext ref71"></span></span>, <span class="tooltip">#72<span class="tooltiptext ref72"></span></span>, <span class="tooltip">#73<span class="tooltiptext ref73"></span></span>, <span class="tooltip">#74<span class="tooltiptext ref74"></span></span>, <span class="tooltip">#75<span class="tooltiptext ref75"></span></span>. While they do not line up to be a poem, they share a common theme and style, and as such should be regarded as one thing.</p>
        <p>The one-liners described a violent rainstorm slowly creeping towards us. Beginning somewhere at the horizon, it &ldquo;crawled closer&rdquo;, culminating in the sun being covered by lead clouds.</p>
        <p>Soon after <span class="tooltip">#75<span class="tooltiptext ref75"></span></span> was sent, the Father spoke with <span class="tooltip">#76<span class="tooltiptext ref76"></span></span>. By our hand something terribly old was unearthed, that which was &ldquo;long lost in time&rdquo;. Surely this was the beginning of a new event.</p>
        <p>We began searching for this puppet, discussing in parallel who it could be. Heart of Spears was suggested as the simplest answer&mdash;it had an affinity for lightning. Another suggestion was that it was the &ldquo;titan Lord of Thunder&rdquo; which was referenced a long time ago in poems <span class="tooltip">#27<span class="tooltiptext ref27"></span></span>, <span class="tooltip">#31<span class="tooltiptext ref31"></span></span>, <span class="tooltip">#32<span class="tooltiptext ref32"></span></span>. Could we expect to be facing the very Lord that has subdued the Heart of Spears eons ago?</p>
        <p>As it turned out, we could. Kallah was the first person to find the puppet in question. We weren&rsquo;t facing Heart of Spears or Slumbering Oden, but <i>Lord of Hail</i>.</p>
        <p>After a quick fight at the storming Great Belfry, poem <span class="tooltip">#77<span class="tooltiptext ref77"></span></span> was sent, which in hindsight gave us a clear answer at the identity of the new puppet. Sent from Lord of Hail&rsquo;s perspective, it was italicized&mdash;meaning we were facing Oden, awoken from his deep slumber. (Another small detail&mdash;as seen during Oden&rsquo;s dream, the puppet used archaic words in its speech&mdash;a pattern that would continue with Lord of Hail).</p>
        <p>As per Kallah&rsquo;s first impression, Lord of Hail had a hefty amount of health (which seemed to increase in proportion to the amount of invaders in his world) and could be invaded by several people at once. Astora Greatsword with Neck Swipe was straight out of Slumbering Oden&rsquo;s arsenal, but it was also augmented by a Drakeblood Greatsword with Storm Ruler&rsquo;s weapon art, and Storm Curved Sword. Akin to Nameless Flame and Heart of Spears, Lord of Hail had two custom spells. The first was a quick burst of wind that would knock the opponents down. The second&mdash;a violent wind blast with a damaging fire orb.</p>

        <span class="video" data-id="180318_0"></span>

        <p>The Lord continued his monologue in <span class="tooltip">#78<span class="tooltiptext ref78"></span></span>, lamenting on how degraded the world around him has become&mdash;&ldquo;naught left but cinders long deranged&rdquo;. The race referenced in the last line is unclear&mdash;it could be the race of old Gods, whose rule had brought the world to such a pitiful state. It could also be the race of Men, many of who were also afraid of ushering the Age of Dark.</p>
        <p>Shortly after <span class="tooltip">#78<span class="tooltiptext ref78"></span></span>, Lord of Hail started using a very peculiar miracle. He would create a stationary floating ball of light\wind. It could be best described by the icon of Wrath of the Gods, but as an in-game particle. It did no damage, but Lord was eager to keep people away from it.</p>
        <p>These wind spheres were not a spell on their own, but rather a part of a spell. During one of the next fights, he held two fingers up and vanished into thin air, reappearing shortly afterwards near the wind sphere. That&rsquo;s right&mdash;Lord of Hail possessed the ability to teleport himself. It was a very powerful ability, as he became invulnerable even during the starting animation. It was, however, used sparingly, and mostly seems to be the Puppeteer&rsquo;s way to give this puppet a way out of fighting up to 5 people simultaneously&mdash;not a way to get out of any slightest danger.</p>
        <p>The Father spoke again in poem <span class="tooltip">#79<span class="tooltiptext ref79"></span></span>, rejoicing at the return of the ancient Lord, and at the fate that would await him. The idea that Lord of Hail is not a true Lord reborn, but a final spark quickly dying down would be further reinforced in the final poems of this event.</p>
        <p>Lord of Hail continued his monologue in <span class="tooltip">#80<span class="tooltiptext ref80"></span></span>, now speaking to us directly. He may have been &ldquo;reborn&rdquo; by reawakening from his long dream and (seemingly) a lifetime of mindless wanderings, but it has certainly taken a toll on his body. Nevertheless, the &ldquo;eye&rdquo; for which he was not forgiven so long ago (<span class="tooltip">#55<span class="tooltiptext ref55"></span></span>) didn&rsquo;t suffer the cruel hands of time. This &ldquo;eye&rdquo; can be interpreted in several ways: it may mean his mind and the wisdom accumulated through eons of life. It could also very literally mean his right eye. As we will see at the end of his final event, his right eye is glowing bright blue.</p>
        <p>After this poem, the Lord became much more aggressive in combat, also summoning all the red signs he could find.</p>

        <span class="video" data-id="180318_1"></span>

        <p>Poem <span class="tooltip">#81<span class="tooltiptext ref81"></span></span> echoes back to Oden&rsquo;s dream, and yet again confirms Lord&rsquo;s tremendous age: &ldquo;Once proudly stood in sunlit halls, then wandered them, destroyed by frost&rdquo; is almost certainly referring to Anor Londo from the times of Lordran and Lothric. There isn&rsquo;t much else to be extracted from this poem.</p>
        <p>As the event went on, poem <span class="tooltip">#82<span class="tooltiptext ref82"></span></span> switches back to Father&rsquo;s perspective. Here we reaffirm that the Lord is not a human in nature. &ldquo;Born of the flame&rdquo;, old enough to have known Gwyn&rsquo;s first title, bearing the title of a Lord himself&mdash;Oden is none other than a derelict god! And a curious god at that&mdash;wishing for the end of the reign of his own kind. Yet as we&rsquo;ve seen for a while now, he clearly opposed the unnatural prolongation of the Age of Fire, calling Gwyn himself a &ldquo;feeble coward&rdquo; in <span class="tooltip">#56<span class="tooltiptext ref56"></span></span>.</p>
        <p>The event continued without any noteworthy things happening: Lord kept summoning people and being invaded, frequently engaging his opponents in gruesome 5v1s. </p>
        <p>In poem <span class="tooltip">#83<span class="tooltiptext ref83"></span></span> the Lord shows that he is fully aware of his fate and of his purpose in the Father&rsquo;s plan. He is the most talkative puppet we&rsquo;ve had throughout the whole event, it&rsquo;s not unbelievable that the Father had shared with him the full extent of his plan. Why Oden decided to go with it is another question&mdash;perhaps he was aware that even with him being an ancient god, he would not be capable of overthrowing the Soul of Cinders. Or perhaps, in the event that he did, the Father did not desire him to acquire the power such a victory would yield. Either way, Lord of Hail was resigned to his fate. (Another curious remark&mdash;it seems that puppet&rsquo;s time as Oden the Armless was Oden being mad\hollow, as stated by the second line).</p>
        <p>The event ended with poem <span class="tooltip">#84<span class="tooltiptext ref84"></span></span>, confirming all that has been already said. Oden, Lord of Hail is an ancient Lord, from eons when Lordran was likely still prosperous. For decades upon decades he has been wandering the world, losing himself and his memories in the process. The Father found him and decided that he was a valuable puppet. By calculated design or lucky improvisation, stitching with the White Vagrant had sent Oden&rsquo;s  mind down the memory lane. And now, restored in mind but not in body, he is a witness to the dead end that the Age of Fire had brought upon this world. Powerless to change that, his one choice is to leave his fate in the hands of the Father. And as the last line of the poem tells us, this fate may be darker than a mere death, as it&rsquo;s truly &ldquo;fit for forlorn&rdquo;.</p>
