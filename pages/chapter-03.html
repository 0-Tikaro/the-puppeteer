        <br>Oden the Armless, Lone Darkwraith,
        <br>Redflame Erik</p>

    <p><span class="versal versal-o">O</span>den the Armless was the first one to appear this day. Tikaro was Dried Fingered and running through Crucifixion Woods when he appeared. Early on in the run, the Puppeteer sent poem <span class="tooltip">#10<span class="tooltiptext ref10"></span></span>, which fairly clearly stated that there were five puppets, not four as originally thought. The last, &ldquo;eastward&rdquo; one is the Heart of Spears, which at this time has not appeared yet.</p>
    <p>Narcolept, who will be one of the main people getting the Puppeteer on camera, recorded a couple of fights with Oden during this event:</p>

    <p>Just as during the previous event, Oden the Armless was eventually replaced by Lone Darkwraith, when Tikaro got to the Cathedral of the Deep. The puppet was invading and sometimes grabbing mad white signs in the Cleansing Chapel. After summoning Narcolept for a fight, the Puppeteer sent him poem <span class="tooltip">#11<span class="tooltiptext ref11"></span></span>. This one is likely a continuation of <span class="tooltip">#10<span class="tooltiptext ref10"></span></span> in foreshadowing the appearance of Heart of Spears.</p>

    <p>Redflame Erik appeared in the Farron Keep, trailing the run as became common in the last month. Also, around this point it could be vaguely seen that the puppets had their own designated areas. Redflame Erik was tied to the Farron Keep, White Vagrant to Irithyll, Lone Darkwraith to Cathedral of the Deep, and Oden the Armless to Irithyll Dungeon. They didn&rsquo;t invade only these areas, but rather were tied to them thematically. This will be seen clearly during the final event, almost four months in the future.</p>

    <p>At the end of the event, the Puppeteer joined the Discord server and sent poem <span class="tooltip">#12<span class="tooltiptext ref12"></span></span> himself. Joining, posting a new poem, and leaving would become the main way he would communicate with us for a while.</p>
    <p>Several days later, on January 25, the Puppeteer sent friend requests to the moderators of SL90 discord. Narcolept received poem <span class="tooltip">#13<span class="tooltiptext ref13"></span></span>, along with a string of broken AAAs. Alex got a a lot more AAAs that are qualified here as <span class="tooltip">#14<span class="tooltiptext ref14"></span></span>. Tikaro and Raff have sent friend requests to the Puppeteer. Both were accepted, and the two got <span class="tooltip">#15<span class="tooltiptext ref15"></span></span> and <span class="tooltip">#16<span class="tooltiptext ref16"></span></span> (haha), respectively. The only poem out of the four things sent expanded upon the then cryptic foreshadowing of what would happen to Redflame Erik and Lone Darkwraith during the next event.</p>
