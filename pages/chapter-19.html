        <p><span class="versal versal-i">I</span>mmediately after the story concluded on May 14, the Puppeteer went completely out of character and offered to answer any questions about the event. The resulting &ldquo;Q&A&rdquo; is presented here in a mostly unedited format (save for a couple of additional descriptions). Keep in mind&mdash;this was never positioned as a serious interview. Both sides had fun and joked around.</p>

        <p>During this time the Puppeteer had also shared the source images and list of music he used for the Puppet's Twitch backdrop. You may find all of that information in Appendix E.</p>

                <br>- reactions to Heart of Spears and Nameless Flame
                <br>- moment when the story finally came together in my mind. A fair amount of whatever happened around end of Ferbuary - March was winged on the fly. Later things were more planned out.
                <br>- Kiln fights and Dark Firelink ending. It was a long time coming for me.

                <br>Favorites are definitely:
                <br>Oden the Armless - love the idea and the design. If I had to redo the event now, I&rsquo;d take his whole lore in a different direction, probably leaving him armless till the very end.
                <br>Nameless Flame - a total blast to play as.
                <br>The Puppet - literally was in development from the very start. Favorite design and story overall, but it falls apart without the massive lore buildup.</td></tr>

                <br>===
                <br>Within the shaded belltower,
                <br>Where the Fire Keepers slumber,
                <br>Below the bell sleeps the power
                <br>Of Puppet, of cinder, ember.
                <br>
                <br>He who is many of faces
                <br>And he who is strong to the bone,
                <br>Who us with his presence graces
                <br>Whose legacy written in stone.
                <br>
                <br>There lies he, beneath the still bell,
                <br>For now his noble work is done;
                <br>He rest til the dark bell shall knell
                <br>That is never, our hearts he won.
                <br>
                <br>Then sleep well now, our dearest friend
                <br>We know well, all good things must end.</td></tr>
            <tr><td class="Q">Ragg:</td><td>Thx a bunch for all the effort mysteryboy. Loved most of the stuff you did and would&rsquo;ve loved to partake in the final event. But life is a busy dickhead and also large quantities of alcohol are surprisingly bad. Anyway, I dont have any questions. Just wanted to say thanks and playing against you was very fun.</td></tr>
            <tr><td class="Q">Edvard:</td><td>It’s quite amazing that our Puppetmaster here even shows the restraint required to know when to end things. A rather important theme in Dark Souls too, peaceful submission! Least if you ask me anyway.</td></tr>
