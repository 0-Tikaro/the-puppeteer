    /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

    <p>Amazingly, as we started off our run, a special someone joined VC chat... the Puppeteer, who was muted, but could very well hear what we talked about, commenting on what&rsquo;s happening in sometimes very cheeky ways.</p>
    <p>The run continued in Profaned capital, accompanied by poem <span class="tooltip">#170<span class="tooltiptext ref170"></span></span>:
        <br><span class="tooltip">#170<span class="tooltiptext ref170"></span></span>
        <br>Amidst the putrid toxic trash
        <br>once walked a weary, lonely one.
        <br>Foes resolutely would he crush -
        <br>though just a cripple on the run.
    </p>
    <p>Aquamarine dagger was added to the weaponry of the Puppet. Quite soon after beginning the event, we received an invitation for red sign summons in poem 171:
        <br>
        <br><span class="tooltip">#171<span class="tooltiptext ref171"></span></span>
        <br>The truest traitor of his race,
        <br>devolved to mere old nameless thing.
        <br>Now vaguely image shows its face,
        <br>before the Lord on throne of king.
    </p>
    <p>Boss weapons: aquamarine dagger, Astora greatsword, partizan. These did not seem to have custom WAs. Visually, the Puppet was missing one arm, mimicking Oden the Armless. In the fight, the Puppet was especially aggressive when taking out the aquamarine. As always, we got two poems before the run moved onto the next area:
        <br>
        <br><span class="tooltip">#172<span class="tooltiptext ref172"></span></span>
        <br>In silence watched by titan two,
        <br>who fight before his giant soul.
        <br>Fear not, poor sufferer, you too,
        <br>will eaten be alive and whole.
        <br>
        <br>1 LEFT
        <br>
        <br><span class="tooltip">#173<span class="tooltiptext ref173"></span></span>
        <br>Lord dead and gone in gaping maw
        <br>No man or god is now the knight -
        <br>a Sin at which great hungers gnaw,
        <br>a monster with a soul so bright.
    </p>
    <p>In Lothric castle, the Puppet returned to using explosion-based spells, along with a new one - a combination of Farron dart and seething chaos: the projectile did some damage along with a slight knockback; the falling point of the projectile marking the seething chaos mine spot. Here, almost all invasions were Xv1s, as the Puppeteer seemed to keep the invader count limit disabled. Poems 173-175 all came bolded, as if the Puppet was overwhelmed with the enormous power it had acquired, the kill count rising to almost 150.
        <br>
        <br><span class="tooltip">#174<span class="tooltiptext ref174"></span></span>
        <br>No apparition is this flame -
        <br>new certain state of hollow thing.
        <br>Great Sin of Old it is to blame,
        <br>for this great burden it doth bring.
        <br>
        <br><span class="tooltip">#175<span class="tooltiptext ref175"></span></span>
        <br>As embers flicker in the air
        <br>hot wind blows from the sacred sin.
        <br>Sign stones by fog now, if you dare
        <br>to face the thing to hell akin.
    </p>
    <p>In the boss fight, the Puppet utilized area-of-denial spells extensively. Floating chaos was almost constantly present, and multiple mines were cast in an attempt to corner any challenger. The neck swipe weapon art also proved deadlier than ever, dealing ridiculous amounts of damage. The weapons used were the same as in the Irithyll dungeon: Arstor&rsquo;s spear and Drakeblood greatsword, with the noticeable visual flame buff.</p>
    <p>The boss fight proved extremely challenging, with very few succeeding. Eventually, by subduing enough opponents, the Puppet seemed to recover control to some extent:
        <br>
        <br><span class="tooltip">#176<span class="tooltiptext ref176"></span></span>
        <br>Flame rages on in cursed soul
        <br>as knight subdues it with stern will:
        <br>ought not it waste this precious coal,
        <br>left final Lord to gulp with thrill.
        <br>
        <br>1 LEFT
    </p>
    <p>After striking the last challenger down, the run moved to Untended graves, where the Puppet mimicked Nameless Flame&rsquo;s final form, his head covered in a black mist akin to that of harald knights in TRC. He utilized a blackflame-buffed onyx blade, ringed knight sword and spear, and several black pyromancies along with the close-range explosion spell from before. We did not stay in this area for too long, the Puppet reaching the boss fog quite quickly:
        <br>
        <br><span class="tooltip">#177<span class="tooltiptext ref177"></span></span>
        <br>A fleeting spark of human soul
        <br>engulfs the knight in veil&rsquo;s blacks.
        <br>Fog now approach, for it&rsquo;s your goal
        <br>to all provide what it still lacks.
    </p>
    <p>The boss fight in the untended graves was very unique: while the first challenger was summoned into a 1v1 duel, later opponents were brought in as duos, with players fighting the Puppet in the area around the abandoned Firelink shrine. The fight consisted of two parts; first fighting in the area right after Champion Gundyr, after which the Puppet would retreat into the shrine where the second part would begin. The black knights in the area targeted the Puppet, giving the discorders some helping hands in defeating the power-hungry adversary. Eventually, we received poems 178 and 179, signaling a small break.
        <br>
        <br><span class="tooltip">#178<span class="tooltiptext ref178"></span></span>
        <br>As black gives way to scorching steel,
        <br>knight leaves the human flame aside.
        <br>Tasked now to finish final meal,
        <br>it marches on, Sin its one guide.
        <br>
        <br>1 LEFT
        <br>
        <br><span class="tooltip">#179<span class="tooltiptext ref179"></span></span>
        <br>From dark emerged a single face,
        <br>encased in bent and broken steel.
        <br>Exhausted yet from this long race,
        <br>half-hour break it takes to kneel!
    </p>
    <p>After the break, the Puppet headed to the Grand archives:
        <br>
        <br><span class="tooltip">#180<span class="tooltiptext ref180"></span></span>
        <br>Last apparition still to feed
        <br>whom yielded flesh for monster mute.
        <br>To its homeland no roads yet lead -
        <br>one cannot go without a route.
    </p>
    <p>Here, he had new spells that utilized the particle/visual effects of those used by Lothric, younger prince. These included small darts and large explosions of light. At the beginning of the area, the Puppet used the Arstor-Drakeblood combo. The damage seemed to have increased yet again, as some people found themselves mercilessly struck down in mere three blows, should they fail to find an opportunity to heal. Passing through the archives, the Puppeteer posted:
        <br>
        <br><span class="tooltip">#181<span class="tooltiptext ref181"></span></span>
        <br>Corpse given to the voiceless knight
        <br>holds not the tale of Spears sublime.
        <br>Yet in these halls of white sunlight -
        <br>a different tale of ancient crime.
    </p>
    <p>At the top of the archives, the weaponry was changed once more: the Puppet now was rocking the combo of Lucerne and Gotthards. Defeated one final time on the way to the Twin Princes boss fog, red signs were requested:
        <br>
        <br><span class="tooltip">#182<span class="tooltiptext ref182"></span></span>
        <br>Amalgam of the sunlit prison
        <br>along with feathers airy and white.
        <br>Your signs awaits image arisen,
        <br>from knight enduring fevered light.
    </p>
    <p>In the boss fight, the Puppet used gold pine bundles to push the damage even further. By this point, the spells Lothric used were becoming larger and larger in size. One more challenger was beckoned in a familiar way:
        <br>
        <br><span class="tooltip">#183<span class="tooltiptext ref183"></span></span>
        <br>Fake imitation of the old
        <br>won&rsquo;t dare take up more time.
        <br>Just over here, last Lord so cold,
        <br>the last banquet of this great climb.
        <br>
        <br>1 LEFT
    </p>
    <p>After the final battle here, we were told to move on to the Kiln of the First Flame...
        <br>
        <br><span class="tooltip">#184<span class="tooltiptext ref184"></span></span>
        <br>Our goal is clear, for we are done.
        <br>No lords or souls are left to eat.
        <br>Great Sin of Old, your time has come!
        <br>This hellish knight will do the feat.
    </p>
    <p>Here, something unexpected happened. We were summoned ALONGSIDE the Puppet to combat the Soul of Cinder in a 5v1 engagement. Having absorbed its soul, the fight was followed up by a similar one... 5v1s against the now-strengthened Puppet:
        <br>
        <br><span class="tooltip">#186<span class="tooltiptext ref186"></span></span>
        <br>INTO THICK ASH THE PIECES FALL
        <br>STRONG JAW SUBDUES THE BLAZING HEAD
        <br>WORLD&rsquo;S FLAME WILL NOT STAND TALL
        <br>AS KNIGHT ENGULFS ITS FINAL SHRED
    </p>
    <p>Multiple times, five people were summoned. Multiple times, we killed the Puppet. Yet every time, it stood back up, becoming stronger, faster. In fights, the Puppet began to deal massive damage, enough to two-shot almost any given opponent, while moving with an enormous speed. He also seemed to acquire passive hyper armor as some attacks did not make him flinch at all. The fights required a decent amount of co-operation from the discorders, as not to hit one another, while also covering those under attack. Finally, one last battle was indicated to occur:
        <br>
        <br><span class="tooltip">#187<span class="tooltiptext ref187"></span></span>
        <br>AS SKY GROWS DARK IN ENDLESS NIGHT
        <br>ONE SPARK IS LEFT, UNTAMED AND BRIGHT
        <br>COME EACH ONE NOW, FOR FINAL FIGHT
        <br>SOON ENDLESS REST WILL TAKE THE KNIGHT.
        <br>
        <br>1 LEFT
    </p>
    <p>With the final group of five managing to defeat the Puppet, it was finally over. The months-long journey was complete:
        <br>
        <br><span class="tooltip">#188<span class="tooltiptext ref188"></span></span>
        <br>This world, old and decayed,
        <br>it now, alas, no one controls.
        <br>Left standing is one richest shade
        <br>of the Darkest of Souls.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>

        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
    </p>
    <p>But it was not over. Not yet. Once more, we returned to the Untended graves, where we had one final set of showdowns, via red sign summons To preserve the impact of these fights, we will not be documenting anything here - please watch the videos, for which we will hopefully be able to acquire the music the Puppeteer played in the background. For some, the emotional impact was... enormous.</p>
    <p>Eventually, the Puppeteer announced that the invaders would be given one last attempt to fight. Asked to provide a name, Fanboy spoke up, naming his character, Valerie of Carim - which was accepted by a couple others as a fitting final opponent for the Puppet.</p>
    <p>After the fight, we were instructed to place our red signs one final time, but now not for a fight... again, what transpired here will not be documented in text to preserve the impact - please watch the videos.</p>
    <p>Content with the results of all of his work over the past several months, the Puppeteer posted one final poem:
        <br><span class="tooltip">#189<span class="tooltiptext ref189"></span></span>
        <br>Knight takes a seat under dark bell,
        <br>great deed is done, the embers fade.
        <br>It now shall rest, enchain the hell
        <br>till even time itself will fade.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>-THE END-
    </p>
    <p>Following which, he finally broke character completely, letting us have a Q&A session regards to, well, anything related to the project and him... if you want to read our questions and the Puppeteer&rsquo;s answers, please check out the Puppeteer-related channel on the SL90 discord, <span class="tooltip">#01010000<span class="tooltiptext ref01010000"></span></span>.</p>
    <p>During the event, the Puppeteer used Twitch to add custom music to the boss segments of the run, as well as provide some background imagery. Whole collection of images can be found here: https://imgur.com/a/Yct4b7M</p>
