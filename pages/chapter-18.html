            <br>The Puppet</p>

        <p>The long-awaited day has come. The culmination of the most prominent event if the whole story was upon us. We were excited, but also undeniably sad: the end of the story would go hand-in-hand with the Puppeteer&rsquo;s disappearance.</p>
        <p>During this event, he gradually built up very active interactions with all of us. On the first day, they mainly manifested themselves in occasional emote usage. On the second day, he would listen to our occasional requests and responding to them. On this final day, he joined our voice-chat channel in Discord. While he stayed mute through the whole finale, this allowed him to listen to us experience his final work as closely as possible.</p>
        <p>The twilight was upon the Puppet, as it came down from the storming ruins of Archdragon Peak. As rested as such an artificial unliving being could be, it marched on through Irithyll Dungeon&rsquo;s neglected halls, arriving in the ruins of the Profaned Capital.</p>

        <img src="../assets/images/180511_twitch25.jpg" data-action="zoom"/>

        <p>It would be here where we would get the final conclusion on the long story of Oden. We have learned of his ancient past as a Lord of Thunder and later Lord of Hail. We saw how he was reinvigorated by his last Slumber. Now, we would once more see the quickly-fading facade of the unimportant hollow vagabond&mdash;Oden the Armless.</p>
        <p><span class="tooltip">#176<span class="tooltiptext ref176"></span></span> set the gears into motion, as the Puppet was overcome by yet another apparition. This poem, to no surprise, spoke of the armless wandered in what we have learned to be his darkest times, (which is solidified by <span class="tooltip">#53<span class="tooltiptext ref53"></span></span> and <span class="tooltip">#54<span class="tooltiptext ref54"></span></span> of his slumber).</p>
        <p>The Capital&rsquo;s poems will add just a bit more concreteness atop the already fairly clear story that we have constructed around Oden. We know he was adherent of the Dark, or rather he was an adversary of the Fire. This distaste, in many ways similare to the Father&rsquo;s, has moved him to actions which culminated in his assault of the Ringed City. There, he fought the Heart of Spears for six days and six nights. The Heart of Spears was subdued, its heart pierced by Oden&rsquo;s occult spear.</p>
        <p>Yet something went wrong&mdash;Oden failed in his assault. Perhaps the encounter left him exhausted, and he was overpowered by whatever other forces were left in the city. The cause doesn&rsquo;t matter much, the result does: Oden, the titan Lord of Thunder, was stripped of his godhood and exiled by the gods of Lordran.</p>
        <p>For uncountable years he would be condemned to wander the earth, eventually finding his way to the lands of Lothric. Despite his titanic failure, something of the nobility befitting his origin remained in him, for as Oden fought invaders and hosts deep in the putrid depths of the Dungeon and the Capital, he was still &ldquo;resolute&rdquo;(third line of <span class="tooltip">#176<span class="tooltiptext ref176"></span></span>).</p>
        <p>Yet it&rsquo;s not a far-fetched idea that his past haunted him, for the very same poem describes him as being &ldquo;on the run". On the run from what? The gods of Lordran have perished so long ago even the legends about them are slowly being forgotten. And what else could this living relic of antiquity possibly fear?</p>
        <p>As the Puppet walked through the same places Oden once fought Nosferat in, it mimicked and adopted the towering cripple to the point of also missing an arm. Seeing how that arm would be back in the very next area, it can hardly be tied into the lore as anything but another little homage to what made Oden&rsquo;s first iteration unique.</p>
        <p>What the Puppet did adopt was cripple&rsquo;s magic arsenal, though before the boss-fight it consisted only of the Aquamarine Dagger.</p>
        <p>This allows us to bring up another curious point. Oden appeared in three wildly different forms, and each was heavily reliant on a single type of elemental damage. Oden the Armless made heavy use of magic-infused weaponry. Slumbering Oden was coated in a layer of frostbite. Lord of Hail&rsquo;s greatsword struck with lightning, and his spells revolved around storm.</p>
        <p>This is curious because none of the characters, aside from the Puppet, have made such leaps in magic affinity. As of now we don&rsquo;t have a good explanation as to why this is the case with Oden. Perhaps it&rsquo;s nothing more than the Puppeteer deciding to use Oden to explore a lot of ideas. Perhaps it could be extrapolated that Oden had a natural affinity for various types of magic. The latter idea could have some credit since the character is based on the norse god Odin, who was well-known for his feverous pursuit of all kinds of magical knowledge and wisdom.</p>

        <img src="../assets/images/180511_twitch26.jpg" data-action="zoom"/>

        <p>Poem <span class="tooltip">#177<span class="tooltiptext ref177"></span></span> tied the final ribbon on Oden&rsquo;s. In his steady pursuit of what he thought was true, he went against his entire race, because he believed their reasoning to be blind with fear. He was a traitor for a cause that was nobel from his point of view. He suffered for his choices. And yet, in the very end, he likely found peace in knowing that there was someone else, potentially more powerful than he was, working towards the same goal. With that thought, Oden, the titan Lord of Thunder, the Lord of Hail, the Armless, vanished from the stage.</p>
        <p>He may have disappeared, but his vague recollections still echoed inside the Puppet&rsquo;s fragmented mind. As the capital was searched, its last inhabitants consumed for souls, the mute knight approached the large throne room where another tormented lord awaited.</p>

        <span class="video" data-id="180513_0_0"></span>

        <p>In a fitting manner, the very last setup we saw of Oden was also the very first one we have ever encountered. This boss-fight was very down-to-earth: no custom spells were used, no weird tricks played. Just the temporarily armless Puppet and one of us, duking it out as Yhorm the Giant sat silently and watched.</p>
        <p>This did not make for a boring encounter, for the Puppet was aggressive and invasive in its play-style. It was especially ferocious with the Aquamarine Dagger. The weapon&rsquo;s great strength lies in long comboes it can produce. The Puppet&rsquo;s enormous stamina pool synergized perfectly with it, since a regular character quickly gets exhausted when swinging this thing.</p>

        <span class="video" data-id="180513_0_1"></span>

        <p>This is also the fight that produced one of several Puppeteer memes: at some point when either waiting to be teleported into the arena or just after a fight, Narcolept collapsed. The Puppeteer responded with a fairly non-chalant &ldquo;<i>no collapsing</i>". Many found the timing of the response humorous, and so it stuck around as an inside joke even half a year after the Puppeteer was gone.</p>
        <p><span class="tooltip">#178<span class="tooltiptext ref178"></span></span> was a herald of doom for Yhorm. The giant wasn&rsquo;t removed from the boss arena, instead being a static observer of the fights that went down in his hall. &ldquo;Poor sufferer&rdquo;likely refers to Yhorm&rsquo;s actual in-game lore, for his story is one of heavy sacrifices for his people.</p>
        <p>Noxuary was the last one to fall, with a quick back-and-forth showing yet another way the Puppeteer began interacting with us on this final day:</p>

        <table class="QA">
            <tr><td class="Q">noxuary:</td><td>alright, blackguard nox sign is down</td></tr>
            <tr><td class="Q">Jean:</td><td>Where, now?</td></tr>
            <tr class="A"><td class="A">The Puppeteer:</td><td><i>:no_entry_sign: The capital stands deserted</i></td></tr>
            <tr><td class="Q">Jean:</td><td>You flee, now?</td></tr>
            <tr class="A"><td class="A">The Puppeteer:</td><td><i>yes</i></td></tr>
            <tr><td class="Q">Jean:</td><td>Still a good way to say it</td></tr>
            <tr><td class="Q">noxuary:</td><td>darn</td></tr>
        </table>

        <p>All of his out-of-character comments were italicized (not to be confused with Oden&rsquo;s speech though, all the lore was communicated exclusively via poems).</p>
        <p>The final poem of the area served as a prelude to the next place the Puppet was to desolate. <span class="tooltip">#179<span class="tooltiptext ref179"></span></span>, as you may see, is bold. Having fended off all of us&mdash;weathered invaders out for its blood&mdash;and banished Oden&rsquo;s final apparition from its mind, the Puppet was prepared for another feast. It&rsquo;s a grotesque thought experiment to try to imagine just how &ldquo;Lord dead and gone in gaping maw&rdquo;must have looked like. The gruesome imagery of a Puppet literally tearing the souls apart with its teeth only reinforces the primal feeling the Puppet gave off. Yet again we were reminded&mdash;it&rsquo;s not a living creature in the fullest sense.</p>

        <p class="killcount">&mdash;137&mdash;</p>

        <p>Yhorm the Giant has fallen, and Father&rsquo;s creation has consumed its third Lord. As we were taught to expect, this meant that the Puppet would be engulfed by the Soul of Cinder&rsquo;s flames for the next area.</p>

        <img src="../assets/images/180511_twitch31.jpg" data-action="zoom"/>

        <p>The prediction was correct. Shortly, Twitch background has shown the Puppet beginning its assault at the last bastion of the world of Dark Souls 3&mdash;the Lothric Castle.</p>
        <p>Along with the twitch image, the Father has spelled out for us the grim fate the Puppet was facing. Through <span class="tooltip">#180<span class="tooltiptext ref180"></span></span> we have learned of two things. From the end of Chapter XVI up until this moment, this written interpretation of the events made no distinction between the times the Puppet was overcome by a surfacing apparition of one of the Father&rsquo;s old puppets, or by the raging souls of Lords of Cinders. But this poem makes it clear: infernal blaze of Great Old Sin is not a transient memory. With the consumption of the third Lord, the Puppet&rsquo;s own soul has crossed the point of no return, which was tangentially heralded by <span class="tooltip">#169<span class="tooltiptext ref169"></span></span>, in the depths of Irithyll Dungeon.</p>
        <p>It&rsquo;s also worth noting that the Father refers to his marionette as a &ldquo;hollow thing&rdquo;. It may mean that the mute knight is indeed &ldquo;hollow&rdquo; in the Dark Souls sense of the word&mdash;that it is technically not truly dead, but also persisting only on basic instincts rather than sophisticated thoguht. It may also mean that the Puppet is physically hollow on the inside&mdash;being a vessel of sorts, continously being filled by the souls it consumes on its arduous journey.</p>
        <p>Dissapointingly for both of us, very little information is actually preserved from this part of the Puppeteer&rsquo;s Dried Finger run. Due to a unprecedented purge of our footage from Streamable (which is a service many of us used to share in-game clips), no footage from this area, besides the boss fight, survived. Nevertheless, we can reconstruct the events down to decent details, and use our imagination to fill in the gaps.</p>
        <p>The Puppet, engulfed by Sin&rsquo;s raging flames, assaulted the Lothric Castle and disposed of Dancer of the Boreal Valley. It then immediately marched onwards, ignoring Consumed King&rsquo;s Gardens for the time being. Pulled forward by the nagging of its one and only purpose, it fought through the waves of Lothric Knights mixed with us&mdash;the invaders.</p>
        <p>Each time the Puppet has consumed a Lord and was enflamed by Sin, it grew more powerful. The Abyss Watchers left it feeble and miserable, despite enhancing its accursed spear. Aldrich, along with the remnants of Gwyndolin, gave birth to two special pyromancies as well as further enchancing its main weapon. Now, Yhorm&rsquo;s hellish soul has coated both of Puppet&rsquo;s weapons in its flames, and added a third pyromancy to its arsenal. The pyromancy was a mix between a Farron Dart and Seething Chaos: a quick flick of knight&rsquo;s arm threw down a mine which would explode violently after several seconds. Large explosion radius already made Seething Chaos a good tool for crowd-control, and quick animations allowed to render large areas dangerous. (Though there is one note for that: as seen in the boss clip and during the later areas of the event, no matter how many Seething Chaos mines were thrown down, only two would explode. This is likely a limitation on the game&rsquo;s part that the Puppeteer had overlooked.)</p>

        <img src="../assets/images/180511_twitch32.jpg" data-action="zoom"/>

        <p>The Puppet&rsquo;s growing powers would have allowed it to demolish the area extremely quickly, were it not for us. Summoning limits were unlocked once again, and up to <b>five</b> of us were able to hunt the mute knight simultaneously. By a lucky remark left in the discord chat, we know that at one point the Puppet was facing an insurmountable challenge of attempting to defeat five fully-healed invaders, buffed by the Lothric Priests&rsquo; Sacred Oath (which, if you are unaware, is more potent than the regular Sacred Oath). The Puppet, despite now being a lot more powerful than a legitimate character, fell short of that, and was forced back to a bonfire.</p>
        <p>Eventually, the mute knight has sterilized the lower floors of the towering castle. Inescapable as a force of nature, it disposed of the Pilgrim Butterfly which was controlled the Dragonslayer Armor and beckoned us to the bridge. <span class="tooltip">#181<span class="tooltiptext ref181"></span></span> invokes an idea that at this moment, the Puppet was at the zenith of its power as of this part of the journey. No longer degenerated into a meek thing by the Great Old Sin&rsquo;s invasive flames, but rather letting it seep through its carcass and abusing its power.</p>

        <img src="../assets/images/180511_twitch33.jpg" data-action="zoom"/>
        <span class="video" data-id="180513_1_0"></span>

        <p>Alex Roe&rsquo;s haunting <i>Night of the Hunt</i> played on the background as the Puppet unleashed hell on us. It was generally regarded as one of the most chaotic fights of the whole event. The Puppet was relentless, pursuing its opponent (who was, as always during the boss fights, alone) until one of the fighters dropped dead. The pyromancies were thrown out very frequently, making aggression difficult and sometimes forcing us into panicked retreating. The fact that the Puppet was lagging during several points of the fight also did not help. This last part was later explained by the Puppeteer, who said: &ldquo;dragonslayer arena gets terribly laggy&rdquo;.</p>
        <p>Very few succeeded in overcoming the mute knight. Yet, the Puppet&rsquo;s momentary endulgence in Great Old Sin&rsquo;s power was nearing its end. The Father dispels the idea that it is completely gone, though. <span class="tooltip">#182<span class="tooltiptext ref182"></span></span> clearly states that from now on, the Puppet&rsquo;s soul will keep burning as if that of a true Lord of Cinder. The consumption of Yhorm had not only brought the mute knight over this threshold, but has also acquainted it with this accursed power enough to rule over it. Per the second line, it was not the flame dying down inside the Puppet, but the Puppet subduing the flame but its force of will.</p>
        <p>It is also curious to note that despite this image of the Puppet&rsquo;s soul continuously becoming more and more like that of the Soul of Cinders/Great Old Sin, the third line of <span class="tooltip">#182<span class="tooltiptext ref182"></span></span> states that the Puppet must not waste the flame recklessly. Does this mean that the flame of Sin could die down despite the fundamental alterations of the soul of the synthetic being?</p>
        <p>With this question up for interpretation, the Lothric Castle had fallen into dead, sterile silence&mdash;only Puppet&rsquo;s weary steps echoing through its halls.</p>

        <p class="killcount">&mdash;145&mdash;</p>

        /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

        <p>Amazingly, as we started off our run, a special someone joined VC chat... the Puppeteer, who was muted, but could very well hear what we talked about, commenting on what&rsquo;s happening in sometimes very cheeky ways.</p>
        <p>The run continued in Profaned capital, accompanied by poem <span class="tooltip">#170<span class="tooltiptext ref170"></span></span>:
            <br><span class="tooltip">#170<span class="tooltiptext ref170"></span></span>
            <br>Amidst the putrid toxic trash
            <br>once walked a weary, lonely one.
            <br>Foes resolutely would he crush -
            <br>though just a cripple on the run.
        </p>
        <p>Aquamarine dagger was added to the weaponry of the Puppet. Quite soon after beginning the event, we received an invitation for red sign summons in poem 171:
            <br>
            <br><span class="tooltip">#171<span class="tooltiptext ref171"></span></span>
            <br>The truest traitor of his race,
            <br>devolved to mere old nameless thing.
            <br>Now vaguely image shows its face,
            <br>before the Lord on throne of king.
        </p>
        <p>Boss weapons: aquamarine dagger, Astora greatsword, partizan. These did not seem to have custom WAs. Visually, the Puppet was missing one arm, mimicking Oden the Armless. In the fight, the Puppet was especially aggressive when taking out the aquamarine. As always, we got two poems before the run moved onto the next area:
            <br>
            <br><span class="tooltip">#172<span class="tooltiptext ref172"></span></span>
            <br>In silence watched by titan two,
            <br>who fight before his giant soul.
            <br>Fear not, poor sufferer, you too,
            <br>will eaten be alive and whole.
            <br>
            <br>1 LEFT
            <br>
            <br><span class="tooltip">#173<span class="tooltiptext ref173"></span></span>
            <br>Lord dead and gone in gaping maw
            <br>No man or god is now the knight -
            <br>a Sin at which great hungers gnaw,
            <br>a monster with a soul so bright.
        </p>
        <p>In Lothric castle, the Puppet returned to using explosion-based spells, along with a new one - a combination of Farron dart and seething chaos: the projectile did some damage along with a slight knockback; the falling point of the projectile marking the seething chaos mine spot. Here, almost all invasions were Xv1s, as the Puppeteer seemed to keep the invader count limit disabled. Poems 173-175 all came bolded, as if the Puppet was overwhelmed with the enormous power it had acquired, the kill count rising to almost 150.
            <br>
            <br><span class="tooltip">#174<span class="tooltiptext ref174"></span></span>
            <br>No apparition is this flame -
            <br>new certain state of hollow thing.
            <br>Great Sin of Old it is to blame,
            <br>for this great burden it doth bring.
            <br>
            <br><span class="tooltip">#175<span class="tooltiptext ref175"></span></span>
            <br>As embers flicker in the air
            <br>hot wind blows from the sacred sin.
            <br>Sign stones by fog now, if you dare
            <br>to face the thing to hell akin.
        </p>
        <p>In the boss fight, the Puppet utilized area-of-denial spells extensively. Floating chaos was almost constantly present, and multiple mines were cast in an attempt to corner any challenger. The neck swipe weapon art also proved deadlier than ever, dealing ridiculous amounts of damage. The weapons used were the same as in the Irithyll dungeon: Arstor&rsquo;s spear and Drakeblood greatsword, with the noticeable visual flame buff.</p>
        <p>The boss fight proved extremely challenging, with very few succeeding. Eventually, by subduing enough opponents, the Puppet seemed to recover control to some extent:
            <br>
            <br><span class="tooltip">#176<span class="tooltiptext ref176"></span></span>
            <br>Flame rages on in cursed soul
            <br>as knight subdues it with stern will:
            <br>ought not it waste this precious coal,
            <br>left final Lord to gulp with thrill.
            <br>
            <br>1 LEFT
        </p>
        <p>After striking the last challenger down, the run moved to Untended graves, where the Puppet mimicked Nameless Flame&rsquo;s final form, his head covered in a black mist akin to that of harald knights in TRC. He utilized a blackflame-buffed onyx blade, ringed knight sword and spear, and several black pyromancies along with the close-range explosion spell from before. We did not stay in this area for too long, the Puppet reaching the boss fog quite quickly:
            <br>
            <br><span class="tooltip">#177<span class="tooltiptext ref177"></span></span>
            <br>A fleeting spark of human soul
            <br>engulfs the knight in veil&rsquo;s blacks.
            <br>Fog now approach, for it&rsquo;s your goal
            <br>to all provide what it still lacks.
        </p>
        <p>The boss fight in the untended graves was very unique: while the first challenger was summoned into a 1v1 duel, later opponents were brought in as duos, with players fighting the Puppet in the area around the abandoned Firelink shrine. The fight consisted of two parts; first fighting in the area right after Champion Gundyr, after which the Puppet would retreat into the shrine where the second part would begin. The black knights in the area targeted the Puppet, giving the discorders some helping hands in defeating the power-hungry adversary. Eventually, we received poems 178 and 179, signaling a small break.
            <br>
            <br><span class="tooltip">#178<span class="tooltiptext ref178"></span></span>
            <br>As black gives way to scorching steel,
            <br>knight leaves the human flame aside.
            <br>Tasked now to finish final meal,
            <br>it marches on, Sin its one guide.
            <br>
            <br>1 LEFT
            <br>
            <br><span class="tooltip">#179<span class="tooltiptext ref179"></span></span>
            <br>From dark emerged a single face,
            <br>encased in bent and broken steel.
            <br>Exhausted yet from this long race,
            <br>half-hour break it takes to kneel!
        </p>
        <p>After the break, the Puppet headed to the Grand archives:
            <br>
            <br><span class="tooltip">#180<span class="tooltiptext ref180"></span></span>
            <br>Last apparition still to feed
            <br>whom yielded flesh for monster mute.
            <br>To its homeland no roads yet lead -
            <br>one cannot go without a route.
        </p>
        <p>Here, he had new spells that utilized the particle/visual effects of those used by Lothric, younger prince. These included small darts and large explosions of light. At the beginning of the area, the Puppet used the Arstor-Drakeblood combo. The damage seemed to have increased yet again, as some people found themselves mercilessly struck down in mere three blows, should they fail to find an opportunity to heal. Passing through the archives, the Puppeteer posted:
            <br>
            <br><span class="tooltip">#181<span class="tooltiptext ref181"></span></span>
            <br>Corpse given to the voiceless knight
            <br>holds not the tale of Spears sublime.
            <br>Yet in these halls of white sunlight -
            <br>a different tale of ancient crime.
        </p>
        <p>At the top of the archives, the weaponry was changed once more: the Puppet now was rocking the combo of Lucerne and Gotthards. Defeated one final time on the way to the Twin Princes boss fog, red signs were requested:
            <br>
            <br><span class="tooltip">#182<span class="tooltiptext ref182"></span></span>
            <br>Amalgam of the sunlit prison
            <br>along with feathers airy and white.
            <br>Your signs awaits image arisen,
            <br>from knight enduring fevered light.
        </p>
        <p>In the boss fight, the Puppet used gold pine bundles to push the damage even further. By this point, the spells Lothric used were becoming larger and larger in size. One more challenger was beckoned in a familiar way:
            <br>
            <br><span class="tooltip">#183<span class="tooltiptext ref183"></span></span>
            <br>Fake imitation of the old
            <br>won&rsquo;t dare take up more time.
            <br>Just over here, last Lord so cold,
            <br>the last banquet of this great climb.
            <br>
            <br>1 LEFT
        </p>
        <p>After the final battle here, we were told to move on to the Kiln of the First Flame...
            <br>
            <br><span class="tooltip">#184<span class="tooltiptext ref184"></span></span>
            <br>Our goal is clear, for we are done.
            <br>No lords or souls are left to eat.
            <br>Great Sin of Old, your time has come!
            <br>This hellish knight will do the feat.
        </p>
        <p>Here, something unexpected happened. We were summoned ALONGSIDE the Puppet to combat the Soul of Cinder in a 5v1 engagement. Having absorbed its soul, the fight was followed up by a similar one... 5v1s against the now-strengthened Puppet:
            <br>
            <br><span class="tooltip">#186<span class="tooltiptext ref186"></span></span>
            <br>INTO THICK ASH THE PIECES FALL
            <br>STRONG JAW SUBDUES THE BLAZING HEAD
            <br>WORLD&rsquo;S FLAME WILL NOT STAND TALL
            <br>AS KNIGHT ENGULFS ITS FINAL SHRED
        </p>
        <p>Multiple times, five people were summoned. Multiple times, we killed the Puppet. Yet every time, it stood back up, becoming stronger, faster. In fights, the Puppet began to deal massive damage, enough to two-shot almost any given opponent, while moving with an enormous speed. He also seemed to acquire passive hyper armor as some attacks did not make him flinch at all. The fights required a decent amount of co-operation from the discorders, as not to hit one another, while also covering those under attack. Finally, one last battle was indicated to occur:
            <br>
            <br><span class="tooltip">#187<span class="tooltiptext ref187"></span></span>
            <br>AS SKY GROWS DARK IN ENDLESS NIGHT
            <br>ONE SPARK IS LEFT, UNTAMED AND BRIGHT
            <br>COME EACH ONE NOW, FOR FINAL FIGHT
            <br>SOON ENDLESS REST WILL TAKE THE KNIGHT.
            <br>
            <br>1 LEFT
        </p>
        <p>With the final group of five managing to defeat the Puppet, it was finally over. The months-long journey was complete:
            <br>
            <br><span class="tooltip">#188<span class="tooltiptext ref188"></span></span>
            <br>This world, old and decayed,
            <br>it now, alas, no one controls.
            <br>Left standing is one richest shade
            <br>of the Darkest of Souls.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>

            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
        </p>
        <p>But it was not over. Not yet. Once more, we returned to the Untended graves, where we had one final set of showdowns, via red sign summons To preserve the impact of these fights, we will not be documenting anything here - please watch the videos, for which we will hopefully be able to acquire the music the Puppeteer played in the background. For some, the emotional impact was... enormous.</p>
        <p>Eventually, the Puppeteer announced that the invaders would be given one last attempt to fight. Asked to provide a name, Fanboy spoke up, naming his character, Valerie of Carim - which was accepted by a couple others as a fitting final opponent for the Puppet.</p>
        <p>After the fight, we were instructed to place our red signs one final time, but now not for a fight... again, what transpired here will not be documented in text to preserve the impact - please watch the videos.</p>
        <p>Content with the results of all of his work over the past several months, the Puppeteer posted one final poem:
            <br><span class="tooltip">#189<span class="tooltiptext ref189"></span></span>
            <br>Knight takes a seat under dark bell,
            <br>great deed is done, the embers fade.
            <br>It now shall rest, enchain the hell
            <br>till even time itself will fade.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>-THE END-
        </p>
        <p>Following which, he finally broke character completely, letting us have a Q&A session regards to, well, anything related to the project and him... if you want to read our questions and the Puppeteer&rsquo;s answers, please check out the Puppeteer-related channel on the SL90 discord, <span class="tooltip">#01010000<span class="tooltiptext ref01010000"></span></span>.</p>
        <p>During the event, the Puppeteer used Twitch to add custom music to the boss segments of the run, as well as provide some background imagery. Whole collection of images can be found here: https://imgur.com/a/Yct4b7M</p>
