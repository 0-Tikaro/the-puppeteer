            <p class="chapter-desc">December, 2017<br>White Vagrant, Lone Darkwraith,<br>Redflame Erik, Oden the Armless</p>
            <p><span class="versal versal-t">T</span>he Puppeteer&rsquo;s game began in around the end of December of 2017. It is unknown how much pre-planning went into the event, but it&rsquo;s clear that the set of four puppets were prepared beforehand.</p>
            <p>The very first puppet to appear was the White Vagrant. On December 19th 2017, it appeared during a fight club hosted at Lothric Castle. Wielding a Murakumo and Pontiff Knight Curved Sword, the Vagrant stirred up the attention of fight club participants. At that point no one was even aware of the Puppeteer&rsquo;s existence. Nevertheless, the idea that this &ldquo;White Vagrant&rdquo; was a fellow Discord-member was passed around. It is unclear at which point of the fight club the puppet appeared and disappeared.</p>
            <p>The second puppet, Lone Darkwraith, was first seen on 21th. It appeared during a Dried Finger event hosted in Farron Keep, and agitating the host with careful Ringed Knight Spear plays. The Puppeteer remained silent during the whole event, so other participants were left to wonder on the identity of the player behind the Lone Darkwraith. The connection between White Vagrant and this puppet wasn&rsquo;t yet made.</p>
            <p>This puppet was seen the following day as well. As Raff, one of the discord members, brought a persistent gank-squad in the Great Belfry to everyone&rsquo;s attention. The gank was never found, but what was found was the puppet, dry fingered alone near the bonfire. The Darkwraith fought several people before, again, disappeared without a trace.</p>
            <p>The third puppet, Redflame Erik, appeared during another Dried Finger run on December 23rd. The DF run held place in Farron Keep and in the Catacombs. Host of the DF run, Nosferat, has seen Erik the previous day in the Cathedral of the Deep, so his reappearance was already somewhat suspicions. Moreover, the puppet&rsquo;s name was similar to another character - &ldquo;Blackflame Chloe&rdquo;. Add an extravagant playstyle into the mix, and the interest of the server members was captured. People began trying to figure out the Steam account of the person behind Redflame Erik, and eventually sending him a friend request with the intent of inviting them to the server. It is this point that we can count as the robust &lsquo;start&rsquo; of the Puppeteer&rsquo;s game, because at the end of this event Varyag (the man who sent the steam request and the player behind Blackflame Chloe) has received the poem <span class="tooltip">#1<span class="tooltiptext ref1"></span></span>, which was the culmination of Redflame Erik&rsquo;s appearance.</p>
            <p>The fourth and last puppet of the original roster, Oden the Armless, was seen on the following day. Nosferat was continuing his run and came up to Irithyll Dungeon. Oden was hunting him down throughout the whole area, eventually culminating in a fight on the roof of the church in the toxic swamp of the Profaned Capital. This fight would be much later be remembered in poem <span class="tooltip">#52<span class="tooltiptext ref52"></span></span>, during the time of Oden&rsquo;s recollections.</p>
            <p>The memorable part of Oden was the fact that he was quite literally missing one arm and one-handing all of his weapons. As later tested, the arm was removed via Cheat Engine by setting the proportions to a negative amount.</p>
            <p>Oden followed suite of Vagrant and Darkwraith, appearing and disappearing without notice and not sending any poems.</p>
            <p>On December 27th, White Vagrant appeared during Tikaro&rsquo;s Dried Finger run through the early game. This is also the first recorded appearance of the Puppeteer:</p>

            <span class="video" data-id="171227_0"></span>

            <p>On January 8th 2018 Cephalon was streaming a DF run through the early areas of the game. Oden appeared and invaded him several times, sending poem <span class="tooltip">#2<span class="tooltiptext ref2"></span></span> afterwards. This poem was similar to <span class="tooltip">#1<span class="tooltiptext ref1"></span></span> in that it commented on the Cephalon&rsquo;s in-game character and given out a bit of lore. At this point an idea was echoed that both Oden and Erik are played by the same person - it would be a very unlikely coincidence that there were two separate unrelated players speaking in poems within the span of a couple of weeks.</p>
            <p><span class="tooltip">#2<span class="tooltiptext ref2"></span></span> is also the first poem that references the main character of the Puppeteer&rsquo;s game - the Father, who is the Puppeteer&rsquo;s personal in-universe analogue. He will be the main (and only) driving force of the story, setting in motion all the events. He never appeared as an in-game character, but from the gathered poems we can deduce that the Father is an old man (Oden speaks directly to the Father in <span class="tooltip">#108<span class="tooltiptext ref108"></span></span>) resolutely set on ending the Age of Fire (<span class="tooltip">#8<span class="tooltiptext ref8"></span></span>, <span class="tooltip">#53<span class="tooltiptext ref53"></span></span>). The game&rsquo;s story revolves around the Father&rsquo;s plan to kill the Soul of Cinders, which in the game is referred to as &ldquo;Great Old Sin&rdquo; or just &ldquo;Sin&rdquo;.</p>
            <p>On January 13th, Lone Darkwraith appeared again, disappearing without posting any poems.</p>
            <p>On January 16th, Redflame Erik made another appearance. Now, with all four puppets making an appearance several times, the stage was set for the Puppeteer&rsquo;s game to begin.</p>
