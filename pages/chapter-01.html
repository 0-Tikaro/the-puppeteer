            <p><span class="versal versal-t">H</span>opefully the prologue caught your interest for good. As you will see, this story will switch between dramatic in-character descriptions and more technical out-of-character chronology. I will also remind you that from this point onwards, the story pretends to not know the identity of the Puppeteer. This is done for the sake of emulating the atmosphere of the original narrative.</p>
            <p>Enjoy.</p>

            <p>Just how much planning went into the story is unknown, but we can be fairly certain that, just as the lore hinted at the Father finding and preparing his four puppets before we ever saw them, the Puppeteer had laid out some general ideas before attempting to run the narrative.</p>

            <p>Our first encounter with the Puppeteer dates back to December 19th, 2017. During the European evening, one of the frequent SL90 Discord members was hosting a fight club near the Lothric Castle bonfire. Everything was going as usual, with our members duking it out and generally chilling and having good-natured fun.</p>

            <p>It was then when <i>White Vagrant</i> came out of nowhere, and captured our interest. Shining white with Untrue White Ring&rsquo;s effect, the spirit came at us wielding a Murakumo in the main hand and Pontiff Knight&rsquo;s Curved Sword as a sidearm. He got into our fight club not by a red sign, but by a seemingly random invasion. At first we thought nothing of him, as it&rsquo;s not too rare that a passing-by invader should encounter our then-frequent fight clubs. And we always welcomed them, both if they participated in our brawls or if they came in with all guns blazing, trying to murder every single living being in that world. The Vagrant was of the former variety, seemingly happy to participate under the generic fight club rules. And he quickly proved himself to be a tough opponent, disposing of many before finally dying.</p>

            <p>The spirit was dismissed as a random player, even though he kept coming back. Yet something happened which disproved that initial idea. Amidst our own red signs, we have found his. Instantly a question came: "Is he one of us?"&mdash;because we were using a password, and you cannot see summoning signs of people who do not share a password with you. Some vain attempts were made to find the man behind the character. But, of course, the Puppeteer remained silent. After this remarkable red sign moment, White Vagrant vanished just as suddenly as he appeared.</p>
            
            <p>Our interest was grabbed, but a singular occurrence would not hold it for long&mdash;and the Puppeteer was completely aware of it. Just two days later, another peculiar event happened. A Dried Finger event was hosted in Farron Keep. And just as the brilliant white spirit several days ago, another puppet came at us suddenly and unexpectedly. Borne by the Red Eye Orb, <i>Lone Darkwraith</i> invaded the event. Visually faithful to the in-game enemies of the same name, he would only resort to using arms of the Ringed Knights during particularly arduous fights. One of our participants was getting especially agitated by spirit&rsquo;s careful use of the long Ringed Knight Spear.</p>

            <p>Having shown himself several times during that event, the Puppeteer once again disappeared without a trace, leaving us to wonder. The connection between this puppet and White Vagrant, whole fairly obvious in hindsight, was not yet made.</p>

            <p>On the following day, Raff, the admin of our community, found a particularly nasty gank-squad at the top of Archdragon Peak. The gank-squad was disposed of, yet in our hunt, inevitably followed by the temporary lack of players in the belfry, we came across a familiar figure. Lone Darkwraith was sitting alone, dry-fingered near the titanic bell. His appearance was by no means prolonged: only a handful of people caught a glimpse before the stalking puppet vanished without a trace. We speculated: this had to have been someone from our community, right? Could it still have been just an incredibly unlikely coincidence?</p>

            <p>As these ideas rippled between us, the Puppeteer had no intentions of letting our zealous imagination die down. On December 23rd, the next puppet entered the stage. By then it was a deep night out in Australia, when Nosferat was finishing up his DF run somewhere in the Cathedral of the Deep. Ready to head off, he was invaded just one last time by a character with a curious name: &ldquo;Redflame Erik&rdquo;. It was remarkable in comparison the usual &ldquo;Ashen One&rdquo; and &ldquo;big_farter99&rdquo;-type usernames, but it wasn't all that uncommon for our group. A lot of us enjoyed creating roleplaying characters with distinct backstories and motivations, so our Australian friend asked around:</p>

            <blockquote>
                <b>Nosferat</b>:
                <br>who&rsquo;s Erik?
                <br>you came and then you left
                <br>;-;
            </blockquote>

            <p>No one answered.</p>

            <p>The very next day, as Noferat continued his DF run, the Puppeteer came back. Redflame forced his way into Nosferat&rsquo;s world, hunting him down near the Farron Keep bonfire. It was an extravagant player: wielding a Chaos Flamberge and Hand Axe as the primary weapons, augmented by the Demon&rsquo;s Scar. True to his name, he was a pyromancer, utilizing Fire Surge&rsquo;s chipping annoyance, Flame Fan&rsquo;s stagger, and Profaned Flame&rsquo;s flashiness (for the lack of a better use).</p>

            <p>It just so happened that one of our regulars, Varyag, was invading as his own pyromancer named "Blackflame Chloe". Redflame and Blackflame worked in tandem, leaving everyone excited. As Nosferat descended into the murky Catacombs of Carthus, Erik kept trailing him. The puppet kept at it for just enough to stay relevant but not enough to raise too much suspicion. Both Varyag and Nosferat tried to figure out the Steam profile of the person behind the pyromancer, but no response came even when the right one got the friend request. And soon afterwards, Redflame Erik vanished into thin air in the way that was characteristic of the Puppeteer early on in the story.</p>

            <p>As the puppet vanished, it left an important mark. At the end of the event, the Puppeteer responded to Varyag in the most bizarre and unexpected way possible. Blackflame Chloe received a poem, <i>the</i> poem that is now known as <span class="tooltip">#1<span class="tooltiptext ref1"></span></span>. Written from Erik&rsquo;s perspective, it is a sort of "congratulation" for a good event and a thanks for nice cooperation. Yet if we pull that aside, one detail can be seen: Erik speaks of himself as hollow, with a rotten soul and decayed meat. The possibility that there is no deeper meaning in this cannot be ignored, but it&rsquo;s already possible that this is foretelling of the fact that the Puppeteer&rsquo;s puppets were "risen from the dead", fixed up and restitched.</p>

            <p>Nosferat was the first one to come across not one, but two marionettes. The very next day, he was moving along through the moldy corridors of Irithyll Dungeon, when he came across a hulking man, clad in dirty armor and tattered clothes. And, the most striking feature of all&emdash;the giant was missing the left arm. (As we later tested, the arm was "removed" by setting its proportions to negative values with Cheat Engine, which made the arm invisible but still fully functional. True to the character, though, the puppet never two-handed his weapons).</p>

            <p>The man was of course Oden the Armless, the fourth and last of the original squad of puppets. He trailed Nosferat throughout the dungeon and, ultimately, confronted him atop the small ruined church in the putrid swamp of Profaned Capital. (This moment would be recalled by Oden himself in poem <span class="tooltip">#52<span class="tooltiptext ref52"></span></span>, but we&rsquo;ll take a proper look at that later).</p>

            <p>After that climaxing moment, Oden had stuck around for a short while as an invader, and then followed suit of White Vagrant and Lone Darkwraith by disappearing in complete silence.</p>

            <p>It must look awfully obvious that the appearance of puppets was no coincidence, and with the blessing of hindsight it&rsquo;s not all that difficult to see. But, at that point, we still had no clue that all of these new invaders were, in fact, played by a single man.</p>
            
            <p>On December 27th, White Vagrant appeared during Tikaro&rsquo;s DF run through the early game. This moment marks the first recorded appearance of the Puppeteer:</p>

            <span class="video" data-id="171227_0"></span>

            <p><i>(This was an important point for me as the Puppeteer. MrRaggaedeman, a fellow invader from our community, was in on the whole mystery, and played as the various puppets every once in a while. This allowed me to record various footage, which alleviated some of the suspicion my apparent deep interest in the narrative would cause.)</i></p>

            <p>On January 8th, 2018, Cephalon was streaming a DF run through the early areas of the game. Oden appeared and invaded him several times, sending poem <span class="tooltip">#2<span class="tooltiptext ref2"></span></span> afterwards. This poem was similar to <span class="tooltip">#1<span class="tooltiptext ref1"></span></span> in that it commented on Cephalon&rsquo;s in-game character and gave out a bit of lore. At this point, an idea was echoed that both Oden and Erik are played by the same person&mdash;it would be a very unlikely coincidence that there were two separate, unrelated players speaking in poems within the span of a couple of weeks.</p>

            <p>Let us also take a moment to note something very quickly: the distinction is between the &ldquo;Puppeteer&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Father&rdquo; is fairly blurred. For the sake of creating some structure, from this point on we will be using the &ldquo;Puppeteer&rdquo; to refer to the real person orchestrating the narrative, and the &ldquo;Father&rdquo; to speak of the in-game character.</p>

            <p><span class="tooltip">#2<span class="tooltiptext ref2"></span></span> is also the first poem that references the main character&mdash;the Father. Working from behind-the-scene, he will become be the driving force behind all the big events of the story. We would never come to see him as an actual in-game character, but from the poems gathered throughout the narrative we can deduce that the Father is an aged man (Oden speaks directly to the Father in <span class="tooltip">#108<span class="tooltiptext ref108"></span></span>) resolutely set on ending the Age of Fire (<span class="tooltip">#8<span class="tooltiptext ref8"></span></span>, <span class="tooltip">#53<span class="tooltiptext ref53"></span></span>).</p>
            
            <p>After the huge drops of the first poems, the Puppeteer's following events held back on the heat. On January 13th, Lone Darkwraith appeared again for a short while, and three days later Redflame Erik did the same.</p>

            <p>All four puppets have appeared several times by now. Though the slow build-up the interest of the audience has been secured, and the first explosive beat of the story could be dropped.</p>
