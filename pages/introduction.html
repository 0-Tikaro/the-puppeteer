        <p><span class="versal versal-h">H</span>ello, stranger on the internet. Let's clear some things up before you get to the real meat of this website. First and foremost, what even is this? <i>The Puppeteer</i> is a written interpretation/retelling of the story which was originally told within a small Dark Souls III community by a man called, unsurprisingly, &ldquo;The Puppeteer&rdquo;. What made the original story unique was the way it was told: through legitimate committed role-playing. It could be compared to a tabletop RPG campaign, but now imagine that the Dungeon Master is as much a mystery as the story itself. The original run of the story took five months from start to finish, and consisted of us slowly uncovering who the Puppeteer's characters were, what were their plans and motivations, and what was our place in the narrative.
        <p>Since this is a retelling, there are several authors. The original narrative&mdash;the fascinating combination of in-game events, poems, and puzzles&mdash;is authored by the man you will come to know as <i>the Puppeteer</i>. The written interpretation&mdash;what you will actually read&mdash;is authored by me, Tikaro, with the help of people from SL90 community.</p>
        <p>As a quick primer, the &ldquo;SL90 community&rdquo; is a discord server for PvP-minded folks in DSIII. To be precise, for those who care about invasions at Soul Level 90 or close to it. SL90 is a great stopping point for invading end-game areas because it avoids the SL120 &ldquo;meta&rdquo; where a big chunk of arena-minded PvPers hang out. To the curious, you may still <a target="_blank" href="https://discordapp.com/invite/usenYsR">enter the server</a>, although you will find that a lot of people mentioned in this write-up have already left it&mdash;for many, the Puppeteer's story was <i>the</i> thing keeping their interest in DSIII. In case you do check the server out, be sure to spend some time in <code>#0101000</code>&mdash;the channel we used to specifically discuss the Puppeteer's story as it was still in progress, and which I also used afterwards during the development of this site.</p>
        <p>In case you don't have any knowledge about Dark Souls III, <i>invasions</i> are one of the two main ways to engage in PvP, the other being participating in duels. A player can obtain a special item which allows them to forcefully break into another player's world and become an <i>invader</i>. Invader's in-game goal is to kill the person whom they have invaded. This may seem like a fun-killing mechanic: having people actively prevent others from completing the game! But in reality it's a lot of fun to be forced into an unexpected encounter and have to think on your feet. As long as neither of two parties are being sad damp towels, the experience is fantastic.</p>
        <p>Why was this write-up needed? During the original run of the story, we have come to realize that we were playing a part in an awfully unique event, none of us seeing anything even remotely similar in the past. The general consensus became that we ought to preserve as much information as possible, so that this story could be later shared with a broader community.</p>
        <p>Let's take a glance at how this write-up is structured. As already saw in the table of contents, it's divided into chapters. First two have an introductory purpose: what you're currently reading gives a rough idea of what this whole thing is, and <a href="synopsis.html">Synopsis</a> will describe the plot and lore in vague details to, hopefully, engage your interest in the narrative even further.</p>
        <p>The following majority of chapters ( <a href="chapter-01.html">Chapter I</a> through <a href="chapter-18.html">Chapter XVIII</a> ) describe the narrative in chronological order. Most of them focus on a single in-game event and everything preceding it. <a href="chapter-19.html">Chapter XIX</a> and <a href="chapter-20.html">Chapter XX</a> are the &ldquo;runner-ups&rdquo; of the story: the former is a collection of questions we posed the Puppeteer immediately after the narrative was concluded, the latter is our personal final thoughts and impressions about the Puppeteer's work.</p>
        <p>Lastly, there are several appendixes. All of them hold additional information that can be referenced with ease. Vestigial information about the Puppeteer's in-game characters, which couldn't be fitted into the actual story, can be found in <a href="appendix-a.html">Appendix A</a>. <a href="appendix-b.html">Appendix B</a> is the archive of the Puppeteer's poems&mdash;his sole method of communication throughout the narrative. All the in-game footage we managed to capture and preserve up to this point is saved in <a href="appendix-c.html">Appendix C</a>, where it's organized per-chapter. Appendixes D and E hold information that is more closely tied to the narrative, you will learn of them as you go. Also, of course, it should be noted that any appendixes can spoil the story for you.</p>
        <p>You may also check out the <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/
        1nSayAT-T_x-Wt6D4sYmfNI7ngeLOznPULrQamtJDQdo/edit#">original Google Doc</a> our community kept updated as the Puppeteer's story was still running. Don't expect to find any hidden gems in it&mdash;it stopped being updated in favor of developing this site. The link is here mainly for archiving purposes.</p>
        <p>So, now you hopefully know what you're getting into. The story is not small, but it's also not Tolkien's <i>Lord of the Rings</i>. I hope you will find it as fascinating as we found the original.</p>
        <p>Lastly, I, Tikaro, by no means an experienced writer&mdash;this retelling is a pet project I wrote in my downtime. If you find something broken, a typo or an awkward sentence, or just want to discuss some bits of the narrative, contact me via <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/TikaroHD">Twitter</a> or <a target="_blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/TikaroHD">Reddit</a>.</p>
