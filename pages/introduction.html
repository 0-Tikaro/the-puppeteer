        <p><span class="versal versal-h">H</span>ello, stranger on the internet. Let's clear some things up before you get to the real meat of this page. First and foremost, what even is this? <i>The Puppeteer</i> is a written interpretation/retelling of the story which was originally told by a man called "The Puppeteer" within a small Dark Souls 3 community. What made the original story unique was the way it was told: legitimate roleplaying, it can be compared to a tabletop RPG campaign where your Dungeon Master is as much a mystery as the story. The original run of the story took five months from start to finish, and consisted of us slowly uncovering who the Puppeteer's characters were, what were their plans and motivations, and what place we had in the story.
        <p>Since this is a retelling, there are several authors. The <i>original story</i>&mdash;the weird combination of in-game events, poems, and puzzles&mdash;is authored by the man you will come to know as "The Puppeteer". The written interpretation&mdash;what you will actually read&mdash;is authored by Tikaro, with the help of people from SL90 community*.</p>
        <p class="annotation"><b>*</b>: As a quick primer, the "SL90 community" is a discord server for PvP-minded folks in DS3. And to be precise, for those who care about invasions**. Soul Level 90 is a great stopping point for invading end-game areas, while also avoiding the SL120 "meta" levels, which is why a community formed around it. To the curious, you may still <a target="_blank" href="https://discordapp.com/invite/usenYsR">enter the server</a>, although you will find that a lot of people mentioned in this write-up have already left it&mdash;for many, the Puppeteer's story was <i>the</i> thing keeping their interest in DS3. In case you do check the server out, be sure to spend some time in <code>#0101000</code>&mdash;the channel we used to specifically discuss the Puppeteer's story as it was still in progress.</p>
        <p class="annotation"><b>**</b>: In case you do not know, <i>invasions</i> are one of the two main ways to engage in PvP in Dark Souls 3 (the other being participating in duels). Any player can obtain a special item, which upon use allows them to forcefully break into another player's world and become an <i>invader</i>. The invader's sole goal is to kill the person whom they have invaded. This may seem like a brutal mechanic for the people getting invaded, but in reality it can be a lot of fun for both parties, provided neither are being sad wet towels about it.</p>
        <p>Why was this write-up needed? During the original run of the story, we have come to realize that we were playing a part in an awfully unique event, none of us seeing anything even remotely similar in the past. The general consensus became that we ought to preserve as much information as possible, so that this story could be later shared with other communities.</p>
        <p>Let's take a glance at how this write-up is structured. As you will see by the table of content, it's divided into chapters. First two have an introductory purpose: what you're currently reading gives a rough idea of what this even is, and <a href="#synopsis_content">Synopsis</a> will describe the plot and lore in vague details. </p>
        <p>The following majority of chapters ( <a href="#c171200">Chapter I</a> through <a href="#c180513">Chapter XVIII</a> ) describe the events of the story in chronological order. Most of them focus on a single in-game event and everything preceding it. <a href="#q_and_a">Chapter XIX</a> and <a href="#closing_thoughts">Chapter XX</a> are the "runner-ups" of the story: the former is a collection of questions we posed the Puppeteer immediately after the story was concluded, the latter is our personal final thoughts and impressions about the Puppeteer's work.</p>
        <p>Lastly, there are three appendices. All of them serve to be archives of information that can be referenced with relative ease. Vestigial information about the Puppeteer's in-game characters, which couldn't be fit into the actual story, can be found in <a href="#characters_content">Appendix A</a>. <a href="#poems_content">Appendix B</a> is the archive of the Puppeteer's poems&mdash;his sole method of communication throughout the story. And all the in-game footage we managed to capture and preserve up to this point is saved in <a href="#video_content">Appendix C</a>, where it's organized in chronological order.</p>
        <p>You may also check out the <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/
        1nSayAT-T_x-Wt6D4sYmfNI7ngeLOznPULrQamtJDQdo/edit#">original Google Doc</a> our community kept updated as the Puppeteer's story was still running. Don't expect to find any hidden gems in it - it stopped being updated in favor of developing this web-page. The link is here mainly for archiving purposes.</p>
        <p>So now you hopefully know what you're getting into. The story is not small, but it's also not Tolkien's <i>Lord of the Rings</i>. I hope you will find it as fascinating as we found the original.</p>
        <p>Lastly, I'm by no means a real writer—this write-up is a pet project I wrote in my downtime.
