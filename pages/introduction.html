        <p><span class="versal versal-h">H</span>ello, stranger on the Internet. Please, take a second and let your imagination run wild: you are sitting in a theater, ready to see a performance. The lights begin to fade, the crowd goes silent as the curtains slowly open up... but hold on, why are you even here? This page, my reader, will tell you all about this weird story you have stumbled upon.</p>

        <p>As you have already read on the title page, <i>The Puppeteer</i> is a role-playing story. Or, to be more precise, it is a written interpretation of said story. The original narrative was run by me, Tikaro, during the first half of 2018, for my friends in a game called Dark Souls III. During this period, my audience from the <i>SL90 Community</i> was engaged in the mystery of a lonely old man with the plan to kill a god.</p>

        <hr>
        
        <p>As a quick primer, the <i>SL90 Community</i> is a Discord server for PvP-minded folks in Dark Souls III (or, it was during the events of the story, I have not kept up with its developments afterwards). During my time in there, it was a relaxed place where invaders could come together and have fun. As of March, 2019, <a target="_blank" href="https://discordapp.com/invite/usenYsR">the server is still public</a> and you are welcome to enter, but you will likely find that a lot of people mentioned in this write-up have already left it. In case you do check it out, be sure to spend some time in the channel titled <code>#0101000</code>&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;this was the place we specifically used to discuss the Puppeteer&rsquo;s story, and which I also used afterwards, during the development of this website.</p>
        
        <p>(In case you don&rsquo;t know much about Dark Souls III, <i>invasions</i> are one of the two main ways to engage in PvP, the other being participating in duels. A player can obtain a special item which allows them to forcefully break into another player&rsquo;s world and become an <i>invader</i>. Invader&rsquo;s in-game goal is to kill the person whom they have invaded. This may seem like a cruel mechanic: invaders are actively preventing others from progressing through the game! And it is cruel, in a way. But it is also a lot of fun, since it forces everyone into new, unexpected situations and gives birth to all kinds of shenanigans. As long as both the invader and his target are having fun, the experience is great.)</p>

        <hr>

        <p>The story began as me fooling around with an alternative Steam account, playfully stalking the PvP events which my friends ran inside the game for the sake of creating a bit of action and mystery in our community. As the time went on and everyone became more and more engaged in what was going on, it grew into this massive narrative with custom in-game mini-bosses and an entangled web of lore. Quite early on, I adopted the alias of &ldquo;The Puppeteer&rdquo;, which became the namesake of the story.</p>

        <p>As you will see, this written version of the narrative is written with me pretending to be a regular player alongside my audience. This is the way I ran the original narrative, and the facade I kept up while working on this website. Because of that, I expect some points to look a bit strange or even pretentious, and I apologize for that in advance.</p>
        
        <p>So, with that being said, why did I decide to write the narrative up? Well, it turned out to be much larger than I initially expected. Seeing what a blast it was for my players and for me, I came to the conclusion that it was worth the time to be able to share that experience (even if in a more passive form) with a larger audience. And, given the fact that you are reading this, I believe I have succeeded.</p>
        
        <p>Now, before I let you loose into the narrative, let&rsquo;s take a glance at how the website is structured. In imitation of a book, it is divided into many chapters. The first two have an introductory purpose: Introduction, which you are reading right now, summarizes what this whole thing is. Immediately following that, the <a href="synopsis.html">Prologue</a> will give you a quick taste of the narrative&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;just enough to hook you, should the story be up your alley.</p>

        <p>The majority of chapters, grouped as &ldquo;The Narrative&rdquo;, give a chronological description of the story. As I have already said, it&rsquo;s written from the perspective of a regular player, and not from the perspective of a &ldquo;Dungeon Master&rdquo;. <a href="chapter-01.html">Chapter I</a> through <a href="chapter-18.html">Chapter XVIII</a> focus on various events that took place during the adventures of my audience. <a href="chapter-19.html">Chapter XIX</a> and <a href="chapter-20.html">Chapter XX</a> are the runner-ups: the former is a formatted transcript of the short Q&A-like chat I had with my players as the Puppeteer immediately after the final event was concluded. The latter holds the closing thoughts of everyone involved.</p>

        <p>There are also several appendixes. All of them hold additional, non-integral information. Information about all of the in-game characters used by me, along with some disconnected, vestigial thoughts about them, can be found in <a href="appendix-a.html">Appendix A</a>. <a href="appendix-b.html">Appendix B</a> is the archive of the Puppeteer&rsquo;s poems. Don&rsquo;t be surprised&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;poems were the main way in which the Puppeteer was communicating with my audience. In-game footage captured by many of the participants is saved in <a href="appendix-c.html">Appendix C</a>. Appendixes D and E hold more story-sensitive information, so you will learn of them as you go. And, of course, it should be noted that all of these appendixes hold spoilers of various severity, so I suggest taking a look at them when they are mentioned in the narrative.</p>
        
        <p>I will also leave a link to the <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nSayAT-T_x-Wt6D4sYmfNI7ngeLOznPULrQamtJDQdo/edit?usp=sharing">original Google Doc</a> me and my players kept updated during the original run of the narrative. Don&rsquo;t expect to find any hidden gems in it&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;it stopped being updated shortly after the conclusion of the story. The link is here mainly for archiving purposes. Should the original Google Doc be unavailable for some reason, its contents are also available in <a target="_blank" href="../assets/misc/legacy_doc.pdf">pdf</a> and <a target="_blank" href="../assets/misc/legacy_doc.txt">plaintext</a>.</p>

        <p>Phew, now that you have a decent idea of what you&rsquo;re getting into, I think you are ready to dive into the real meat of things. The story is not small, but it&rsquo;s also not Tolkien&rsquo;s <i>Lord of the Rings</i>. I hope that you will find it as engaging as me and my players did.</p>
        
        <p>Lastly, I am neither an experienced writer nor a native English speaker. The original story, the written interpretation, this website&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;everything was done as a hobby. While there is no way to polish or fix the original narrative, you can help improve this written version. I am currently actively working on updating the text and polishing up the website.
