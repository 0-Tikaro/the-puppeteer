        <p><span class="versal versal-h">H</span>ello, stranger on the internet. Let&rsquo;s clear some things up before you get to the real meat of this thing.</p>
        <p>First and foremost, what even is this? As you have already likely read on the title page, <i>The Puppeteer</i> is a written interpretation/retelling of a role-playing story. The story in question originally played out within a small Dark Souls III community by a man called, unsurprisingly, &ldquo;The Puppeteer&rdquo;. What made the original story unique was the way it was told. It could be compared to a tabletop RPG campaign, where your Dungeon Master is as much a mystery as the narrative he brings with him. The original run of the story took five months, and consisted of us slowly uncovering the Puppeteer&rsquo;s characters (fittingly called &ldquo;puppets&rdquo;), what their plans and motivations were, and what our place in the narrative was.
        <p>Since this is not an original story, but a retelling, there are several authors. The original narrative&mdash;the fascinating combination of in-game encounters, cryptic poems, and puzzles&mdash;is authored by the Puppeteer. He has made clear effort to remain anonymous aside from that single name, which we will respect. This written interpretation&mdash;what you are about to read&mdash;is authored by me, Tikaro, with the help of people from the SL90 community.</p>
        <p>As a quick primer, the &ldquo;SL90 community&rdquo; is a discord server for PvP-minded folks in DSIII. To be precise, for those who care about invasions at Soul Level 90 or close to it. SL90 is a great stopping point for invading end-game areas because it avoids the SL120 &ldquo;meta&rdquo; where a big chunk of arena-minded PvPers hang out. To the curious, you may still <a target="_blank" href="https://discordapp.com/invite/usenYsR">enter the server</a>, although you will find that a lot of people mentioned in this write-up have already left it&mdash;for many, the Puppeteer&rsquo;s story was <i>the</i> thing keeping their interest in DSIII. In case you do check the server out, be sure to spend some time in channel <code>#0101000</code>&mdash;the place we specifically used to discuss the Puppeteer&rsquo;s work as it was still running, and which I also used afterwards, during the development of this version.</p>
        <p>(In case you don&rsquo;t have any knowledge about Dark Souls III, <i>invasions</i> are one of the two main ways to engage in PvP, the other being participating in duels. A player can obtain a special item which allows them to forcefully break into another player&rsquo;s world and become an <i>invader</i>. Invader&rsquo;s in-game goal is to kill the person whom they have invaded. This may seem like a fun-killing mechanic: having people actively prevent others from completing the game! But in reality, it is a lot of fun, since it forces both sides into unexpected situations and thus gives birth to all kinds of shenanigans. As long as neither of two parties are getting too salted up, the experience is fantastic.)</p>
        <p>Why was this write-up needed? Quite early on in the lifespan of the original, we came to realize that we were playing a part in something extremely unusual and, because of that, exciting. The general consensus became that we ought to preserve as much information as possible, so that the excitement and the fun could later be shared with a much broader audience.</p>
        <p>Now, before you are let loose on the story, let&rsquo;s take a glance at how this write-up is structured. In imitation of a legitimate book, this website is divided into chapters. First two have an introductory character: what you&rsquo;re currently reading hopefully clears up what this whole thing even is, and <a href="synopsis.html">Synopsis</a> will give you a quick taste of the story, so that you, hopefully, stay to read the whole thing.</p>
        <p>The majority of chapters, grouped under the title &ldquo;Narrative&rdquo;, describe the narrative in chronological order. <a href="chapter-01.html">Chapter I</a> through <a href="chapter-18.html">Chapter XVIII</a> tell of the things that happened during the original run of the story, most chapters focusing on a single in-game encounter and the events preceding it. <a href="chapter-19.html">Chapter XIX</a> and <a href="chapter-20.html">Chapter XX</a> are the &ldquo;runner-ups&rdquo;: the former is a transcript of the very short q-and-a session we had with the Puppeteer immediately after the narrative was concluded. The latter holds our personal final thoughts and impressions about the story.</p>
        <p>Lastly, there are several appendixes. All of them hold additional information that can be referenced with ease. Technical information about the Puppeteer&rsquo;s in-game characters, along with various vestigial thoughts, can be found in <a href="appendix-a.html">Appendix A</a>. <a href="appendix-b.html">Appendix B</a> is the archive of the Puppeteer&rsquo;s poems. As you will very quickly come to learn, this was his sole method of verbal communication throughout the narrative. Next, all the in-game footage we managed to capture and preserve is saved in <a href="appendix-c.html">Appendix C</a>. Appendixes D and E hold information that can definitely spoil the details of the narrative for you, so you will learn of them as you go. Also, of course, it should be noted that any appendixes can spoil the story for you.</p>
        <p>I will also leave a link to the <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nSayAT-T_x-Wt6D4sYmfNI7ngeLOznPULrQamtJDQdo/edit?usp=sharing">original Google Doc</a> our community kept updated during the Puppeteer&rsquo;s story. Don&rsquo;t expect to find any hidden gems in it&mdash;it stopped being updated in favor of developing this site. The link is here mainly for archiving purposes. Should the original Google Doc be unavailable for some reason, its contents are also available in <a target="_blank" href="../assets/misc/legacy_doc.pdf">pdf</a> and <a target="_blank" href="../assets/misc/legacy_doc.txt">plaintext</a>.</p>
        <p>Phew, now I hope you have a decent idea of what you&rsquo;re getting into. The story is not small, but it&rsquo;s also not Tolkien&rsquo;s <i>Lord of the Rings</i>. I hope you will find it as fascinating as we found the original.</p>
        <p>Lastly, I am by no means a professional writer. This retelling is a pet project I worked on in my downtime. So if you find something broken&mdash;a typo or an awkward sentence&mdash;or just want to share your thoughts and discuss some bits of the narrative, contact me via <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/TikaroHD">Twitter</a> or <a target="_blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/TikaroHD">Reddit</a>.</p>
