        <p><span class="versal versal-a">A</span>fter the momentary silent appearance of the Nameless Flame, what followed was a string of exposition poems unrelated to in-game events. </p>
        <p>On February 9, poem <span class="tooltip">#49<span class="tooltiptext ref49"></span></span> was left in the discord server. Unknowing of the way the Puppeteer had planned this section of the story, we set out on an fruitless search for a puppet. Archdragon Peak was checked (&ldquo;The bell&rdquo;). &ldquo;Frigid whisper&rdquo; combined with &ldquo;the bell&rdquo; gave an idea to look in the Snowy Mountain Pass, because there was a broken bell in there. Irithyll was suggested as a possibility, because the Small Doll&rsquo;s item description says that it whispers. Even Eleanora (so we checked the Profaned Capital) was suggested as a connection, for its weapon art both rung like a bell and gave a bleed buff. Alas, no puppet was to be found anywhere.</p>
        <p>Poem <span class="tooltip">#49<span class="tooltiptext ref49"></span></span> however, was not tied to an in-game event. Rather, it told of Oden&rsquo;s thoughts as he was in his &ldquo;endless&rdquo; slumber (<span class="tooltip">#41<span class="tooltiptext ref41"></span></span>). Most of the poems speak from Father&rsquo;s perspective, yet some come directly from his puppets. We&rsquo;ve already seen Broken Vagrant speak directly to us. But Oden&rsquo;s speech will be the only one to gain a unique typographic quality: from here onwards all of his poems will be italicized.</p>
        <p>As we will learn throughout this week, this was just the beginning of Oden&rsquo;s long dream. The remains of White Vagrant still have influence on Oden&rsquo;s dream, likely because its soul did not yet merge into Oden completely. </p>
        <p>The interesting part of the poem is the third line. What are the golden rays? Why would they be cursed and, moreover, has Oden cursed them in the past? Associations to the Ringed City were built fairly quickly, as it&rsquo;s the only truly &ldquo;golden&rdquo; area we get to visit in the game, yet that line of thought led us nowhere for now.</p>
        <p>The fourth line is ever more cryptic. It appears as if Oden suddenly hears the ringing of the bell. The &ldquo;bleeding&rdquo; part was for a long time thought in a literal sense (and thus Eleanora kept reappearing in our discussions), but in the end it seems to be just a figure of speech for &ldquo;ringing&rdquo;. The question still stands&mdash;which bell did Oden hear? Was it the Bell of Awakening that brought the Unkindeled from their graves? That line of reasoning looks promising, but as we will later learn, Oden is not an Unkindeled, far from it. In the end, we never figured out the precise meaning of the bell.</p>
        <p>About an hour after poem <span class="tooltip">#49<span class="tooltiptext ref49"></span></span> was sent, <span class="tooltip">#50<span class="tooltiptext ref50"></span></span> followed. Pay close attention to the fact that only one of these lines is italicized. Father speaks of Oden in greater detail, confirming that he can no longer be found in a physical realm, as he is wandering deep inside his dream. It is unknown if Oden in traversing something which could almost be called a physical realm akin to the dreams we see in  Bloodborne, or if it&rsquo;s nothing but the slow uncovering of his memories.</p>
        <p>Nothing else was sent on February 9, and the general consensus became that these poems symbolized Oden going through a &ldquo;rebirth&rdquo; of sorts. As we would come to learn, this was correct.</p>
        <p>We took a last stab at Untended Graves to see if maybe, just maybe, we have missed a puppet. That was not the case, and we were left empty-handed.</p>
        <p>February 10 gifted us with more lore, still being related to Oden&rsquo;s dream. Just as with previous poems, these were not tied to an in-game event.</p>
        <p>Seemingly being in control of his memories, in <span class="tooltip">#51<span class="tooltiptext ref51"></span></span> Oden remembers a &ldquo;great, blood-thirsty mess&rdquo; he was involved in at some point in the past. It is important to note that we have one hint at the time of this memory: Oden was a &ldquo;cripple&rdquo;, meaning he was missing his arm. This means that it couldn&rsquo;t be during Slumbering Oden&rsquo;s events.</p>
        <p><span class="tooltip">#52<span class="tooltiptext ref52"></span></span> was sent shortly afterwards, and it not only shed more light on Oden&rsquo;s story, but also placed <span class="tooltip">#51<span class="tooltiptext ref51"></span></span> fairly firmly inside the timeline. As would become apparent, each subsequent memory of Oden would be placed further in the past than all the previous ones. So <span class="tooltip">#51<span class="tooltiptext ref51"></span></span> had to be the most recent recollection.</p>
        <p><span class="tooltip">#52<span class="tooltiptext ref52"></span></span> talks about an event we can concretely place on the timeline. Oden recalls the time he fought Nosferat in the Profaned Capital, during one of his first appearances. This, in turn, meant that <span class="tooltip">#51<span class="tooltiptext ref51"></span></span> was set after Oden first appeared and before he became the Slumbering Oden. From that, we could deduce that it spoke about one of the Dried Finger runs Oden had invaded.</p>
        <p>On the following day, February 11, poem <span class="tooltip">#53<span class="tooltiptext ref53"></span></span> continued on the puppet&rsquo;s slumber. This one had sparked more discussions, and two general theories arose. First one was that Oden was found by the Father, second that he was found by Pontiff Sulyvahn. You can read more about both of them in the Lore section, here we will say that we have decided that the first theory was the correct one. Going on from that, in <span class="tooltip">#53<span class="tooltiptext ref53"></span></span> Oden recollects one of his darkest moments in life&mdash;the time just before he became Father&rsquo;s puppet. We also learn that Father was not a person of impressive visual qualities, as he &ldquo;seemed just a man&rdquo;. However, Oden, who was undoubtebly a wise being at least due to his age, saw through the man and understood his &ldquo;profaned ambition&rdquo;. This almost certainly refers to the Father&rsquo;s plan to end the Age of Fire.</p>
        <p>Just a couple of minutes after this poem was sent, Tikaro received <span class="tooltip">#54<span class="tooltiptext ref54"></span></span>. Unrelated to recent lore poems, it was the Puppeteer commenting on the Google Doc Tikaro was maintaining at the time (and which would become the basis for this write-up). The timing of a lot of recent events has also been inconvenient for Tikaro, so in that regard this poem was also similar to <span class="tooltip">#35<span class="tooltiptext ref35"></span></span>.</p>
        <p>On February 12, poem <span class="tooltip">#55<span class="tooltiptext ref55"></span></span> resumed Oden&rsquo;s dreaming. It was the first one to give us a glimpse at the moments in time predating the Father, and inching us towards the reality of who Oden was. Even before Father had found him and gave him the &ldquo;last purpose&rdquo;, he was already very old and very much missing an arm.</p>
        <p>The glimpse into the past is the last line: &ldquo;for my clear eye was not forgiven...&rdquo;. We spoke a fair bit about what this could signify, and ultimately came to the conclusion that will be completely clear later:</p>
        <p>just as the Father, Oden was against the synthetic prolongation of the Age of Fire that gods were protecting. And for this &ldquo;clear eye&rdquo;, he was punished. Was he a Chosen Undead long ago, perhaps even before the time when Dark Souls I takes place, and failed in his try to overtake the remaining gods? We didn&rsquo;t have enough information yet to make such a conclusion. We still had a fairly good hunch that he was old, a lot older than other puppets (aside perhaps for the Heart of Spears?).</p>
        <p>The next day confirmed such suspicions, in the enraged shouts of <span class="tooltip">#56<span class="tooltiptext ref56"></span></span>. It becomes apparent that Oden is not just dissatisfied with the state of the world, but was also openly against the path that Gwyn chose. There is an important detail, however. Oden refers to Gwyn as the &ldquo;Lord of Sunlight&rdquo;. This is not the only title that Gwyn had. In the timespan of Dark Souls I he would become known as the &ldquo;Lord of Cinders&rdquo;, and during Dark Souls III he is remembered as the &ldquo;First Lord&rdquo;. &ldquo;Lord of Sunlight&rdquo; was his first title, and for Oden to know it meant that he was alive and present in the times of Lordran.</p>
        <p>After a bit of time, the Puppeteer announced the next in-game event by sending poem <span class="tooltip">#57<span class="tooltiptext ref57"></span></span> along with &ldquo;Great Belfry 0001&rdquo;. The poem was referring to the Nameless Flame, who became the main puppet for the events after its appearance. In hindsight, <span class="tooltip">#57<span class="tooltiptext ref57"></span></span> can be interpreted as the Flame growing and maturing, as it fought more and more people.</p>
        <p>Same as the time we saw the Nameless Flame in the Cleansing Chapel, he was waiting for the red signs. And same as the last time, there were no poems sent during the whole event. The stage was completely occupied by Oden&rsquo;s dream, and Nameless Flame disappeared after giving each one of us a couple of fights.</p>
        <p>The recordings from this day can be seen below:</p>

        <span class="video" data-id="180213_0"></span>
        <span class="video" data-id="180213_1"></span>
        <span class="video" data-id="180213_2"></span>

        <p>We have come to the very end of Oden&rsquo;s dreams. Just one more day remained. On February 15, <span class="tooltip">#58<span class="tooltiptext ref58"></span></span> was sent, each line sent to a different discord channel. &ldquo;Gaol&rdquo; being another word for &ldquo;jail&rdquo;, this one spoke about the ancient times of the construction of the Ringed City. Some time later in the story, this poem also gave us an idea that Heart of Spears and Oden could have met before, as the general consensus became that Heart of Spears is the very first Spear of the Church. Why would he confront Oden for &ldquo;his dark mind&rdquo;? Perhaps Oden&rsquo;s dissatisfaction with the Age of Fire was so strong, he intended to wake\kill princess Filianore and undo the gods&rsquo; grand illusion.</p>
        <p>As a cute gesture, Raff has decided to write his own poem and send it to the Puppeteer:</p>
        <p style="text-align:center;">A hazardous path you’ve walked, my friend
            <br>Yet still, we cannot see the end
            <br>Through stitching sown sinew you’ve shown us a fight
            <br>But when will this challenge pass into the night?</p>
        <p>The Puppeteer was quick to respond with <span class="tooltip">#59<span class="tooltiptext ref59"></span></span>, which, again, was not a part of Oden&rsquo;s dream. He did, curiously, refer to himself as &ldquo;the end&rdquo; of the story (but no, we did not face &ldquo;The Puppeteer&rdquo; as the final boss).</p>
        <p>The very last poem of Oden&rsquo;s dream was sent on the same day and, fittingly, ended this segment of the story on a nice clean <span class="tooltip">#60<span class="tooltiptext ref60"></span></span>. An immediate continuation of <span class="tooltip">#59<span class="tooltiptext ref59"></span></span>, it speaks more about the confrontation between Oden and the &ldquo;slave firstborn of sunlit prison&rdquo;, which also became known as &ldquo;keeper first of secret last&rdquo;. An idea that Oden may have been the &ldquo;titan Lord of Thunder&rdquo; arose, since we know from <span class="tooltip">#27<span class="tooltiptext ref27"></span></span>, <span class="tooltip">#31<span class="tooltiptext ref31"></span></span>, and <span class="tooltip">#33<span class="tooltiptext ref33"></span></span> that Heart of Spears was put to rest by the aforementioned lord. The idea sounded good, but we were not sure it was the case just yet.</p>
        <p>And so, a fairly big chunk of exposition has ended. It was an interesting change of pace from the fairly frequent long in-game events, but it would also become boring if there were many more of these. Fortunately, this was not the case.</p>
