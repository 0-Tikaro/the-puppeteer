        <p class="chapter-desc">February 9–15, 2018</p>

        <p><span class="versal versal-a">A</span>fter the momentary silent appearance of the Nameless Flame, what followed was a string of exposition poems unrelated to in-game events. </p>
        <p>On February 9, poem <span class="tooltip">#49<span class="tooltiptext ref49"></span></span> was left in the discord server. Unknowing of the way the Puppeteer had planned this section of the story, we set out on an fruitless search for a puppet. Archdragon Peak was checked (&ldquo;The bell&rdquo;). &ldquo;Frigid whisper&rdquo; combined with &ldquo;the bell&rdquo; gave an idea to look in the Snowy Mountain Pass, because there was a broken bell in there. Irithyll was suggested as a possibility, because the Small Doll&rsquo;s item description says that it whispers. Even Eleanora (so we checked the Profaned Capital) was suggested as a connection, for its weapon art both rung like a bell and gave a bleed buff. Alas, no puppet was to be found anywhere.</p>
        <p>Poem <span class="tooltip">#49<span class="tooltiptext ref49"></span></span> however, was not tied to an in-game event. Rather, it told of Oden&rsquo;s thoughts as he was in his &ldquo;endless&rdquo; slumber (<span class="tooltip">#41<span class="tooltiptext ref41"></span></span>). Most of the poems speak from Father&rsquo;s perspective, yet some come directly from his puppets. We&rsquo;ve already seen Broken Vagrant speak directly to us. But Oden&rsquo;s speech will be the only one to gain a unique typographic quality: from here onwards all of his poems will be italicized.</p>
        <p>As we will learn throughout this week, this was just the beginning of Oden&rsquo;s long dream. The remains of White Vagrant still have influence on Oden&rsquo;s dream, likely because its soul did not yet merge into Oden completely. </p>
        <p>The interesting part of the poem is the third line. What are the golden rays? Why would they be cursed and, moreover, has Oden cursed them in the past? Associations to the Ringed City were built fairly quickly, as it&rsquo;s the only truly &ldquo;golden&rdquo; area we get to visit in the game, yet that line of thought led us nowhere for now.</p>
        <p>The fourth line is ever more cryptic. It appears as if Oden suddenly hears the ringing of the bell. The &ldquo;bleeding&rdquo; part was for a long time thought in a literal sense (and thus Eleanora kept reappearing in our discussions), but in the end it seems to be just a figure of speech for &ldquo;ringing&rdquo;. The question still stands - which bell did Oden hear? Was it the Bell of Awakening that brought the Unkindeled from their graves? That line of reasoning looks promising, but as we will later learn, Oden is not an Unkindeled, far from it. In the end, we never figured out the precise meaning of the bell.</p>
        <p>About an hour after poem <span class="tooltip">#49<span class="tooltiptext ref49"></span></span> was sent, <span class="tooltip">#50<span class="tooltiptext ref50"></span></span> followed. Take attention to how only one these lines is italicized. Father speaks of Oden in greater detail, confirming that he can no longer be found in a physical realm, as he is wandering deep inside his dream. It is unknown if this dream is meant to be something similar to Bloodborne&rsquo;s dreams, or if it&rsquo;s a more realistic dream where Oden is just going his memories separated by unimportant haze.</p>
        <p>Nothing else was sent on February 9, and the general consensus became that these poems symbolized Oden going through a &ldquo;rebirth&rdquo; of sorts. As we would come to learn, this was correct.</p>
        <p>We took a last stab at Untended Graves to see if maybe, just maybe, we have missed a puppet. That was not the case, and we were left empty-handed.</p>
        <p>February 10 gifted us with more lore, still being related to Oden&rsquo;s dream. Just as with previous poems, these were not tied to an in-game event.</p>
        <p>Seemingly being in control of his memories, in <span class="tooltip">#51<span class="tooltiptext ref51"></span></span> Oden remembers a &ldquo;great, blood-thirsty mess&rdquo; he was involved in at some point in the past. It is important to note that we have one hint at the time of this memory: Oden was a &ldquo;cripple&rdquo;, meaning he was missing his arm. This means that it couldn&rsquo;t be during Slumbering Oden&rsquo;s events.</p>
        <p><span class="tooltip">#52<span class="tooltiptext ref52"></span></span> was sent shortly afterwards, and it not only shed more light on Oden&rsquo;s story, but also placed <span class="tooltip">#51<span class="tooltiptext ref51"></span></span> fairly firmly inside the timeline. As would become apparent, each subsequent memory of Oden would be placed further in the past than all the previous ones. So <span class="tooltip">#51<span class="tooltiptext ref51"></span></span> had to be the most recent recollection.</p>
        <p><span class="tooltip">#52<span class="tooltiptext ref52"></span></span> talks about an event we can concretely place on the timeline. Oden recalls the time he fought Nosferat in the Profaned Capital, during one of his first appearances. This, in turn, meant that <span class="tooltip">#51<span class="tooltiptext ref51"></span></span> was set after Oden first appeared and before he became the Slumbering Oden. From that, we could deduce that it spoke about one of the Dried Finger runs Oden had invaded.</p>
        <p>On the following day, February 11, poem <span class="tooltip">#53<span class="tooltiptext ref53"></span></span> continued on the puppet&rsquo;s slumber. This one had sparked more discussions, and two general theories arose. First one was that Oden was found by the Father, second that he was found by Pontiff Sulyvahn. You can read more about both of them in the Lore section, here we will say that we have decided that the first theory was the correct one. Going on from that, in <span class="tooltip">#53<span class="tooltiptext ref53"></span></span> Oden recollects one of his darkest moments in life - the time just before he became Father&rsquo;s puppet. We also learn that Father was not a person of impressive visual qualities, as he &ldquo;seemed just a man&rdquo;. However, Oden, who was undoubtebly a wise being at least due to his age, saw through the man and understood his &ldquo;profaned ambition&rdquo;. This almost certainly refers to the Father&rsquo;s plan to end the Age of Fire.</p>
        <p>Just a couple of minutes after this poem was sent, Tikaro received <span class="tooltip">#54<span class="tooltiptext ref54"></span></span>. Unrelated to recent lore poems, it was the Puppeteer commenting on the google doc Tikaro was maintaining at the time (and which would become the basis for this write-up). The timing of a lot of recent events has also been inconvenient for Tik, so in that regard this poem was also similar to <span class="tooltip">#35<span class="tooltiptext ref35"></span></span>.</p>
        <p>On February 12, poem <span class="tooltip">#55<span class="tooltiptext ref55"></span></span> resumed Oden&rsquo;s dreaming. It was the first one to give us a glimpse at the moments in time predating the Father, and inching us towards the reality of who Oden was. Even before Father had found him and gave him the &ldquo;last purpose&rdquo;, he was already very old and very much missing an arm.</p>
        <p>The glimpse into the past is the last line: &ldquo;for my clear eye was not forgiven...&rdquo;. We spoke a fair bit about what this could signify, and ultimately came to the conclusion that will be completely clear later:</p>
        <p>just as the Father, Oden was against the synthetic prolongation of the Age of Fire that gods were protecting. And for this &ldquo;clear eye&rdquo;, he was punished. Was he a Chosen Undead long ago, perhaps even before the time when Dark Souls 1 takes place, and failed in his try to overtake the remaining gods? We didn&rsquo;t have enough information yet to make such a conclusion. We still had a fairly good hunch that he was old, a lot older than other puppets (aside perhaps for the Heart of Spears?).</p>
        <p>The next day confirmed such suspicions, in the enraged shouts of <span class="tooltip">#56<span class="tooltiptext ref56"></span></span>. It becomes apparent that Oden is not just dissatisfied with the state of the world, but was also openly against the path that Gwyn chose. There is an important details, however. Oden refers to Gwyn as the &ldquo;Lord of Sunlight&rdquo;. This is not the only title that Gwyn had. During the Dark Souls 1 he would become known as the &ldquo;Lord of Cinders&rdquo;, and during Dark Souls 3 he would become known as the &ldquo;First Lord&rdquo;. &ldquo;Lord of Sunlight&rdquo; was his first title, and for Oden to know it meant that he was alive and present maybe even before the events of the first game.</p>
        <p>After a bit of time, the Puppeteer announced the next in-game event by sending poem <span class="tooltip">#57<span class="tooltiptext ref57"></span></span> along with &ldquo;Great Belfry 0001&rdquo;. The poem was referring to the Nameless Flame, who became the main puppet for the events after its appearance. In hindsight, <span class="tooltip">#57<span class="tooltiptext ref57"></span></span> can be interpreted as the Flame growing and maturing, as it fought more and more people.</p>
        <p>Same as the time we saw the Nameless Flame in the Cleansing Chapel, he was waiting for the red signs. And same as the last time, there were no poems sent during the whole event. The stage was completely occupied by Oden&rsquo;s dream, and Nameless Flame disappeared after giving each one of us a couple of fights.</p>
        <p>The recordings from this day can be seen below:</p>

        <span class="video" data-id="180213_0"></span>
        <span class="video" data-id="180213_1"></span>
        <span class="video" data-id="180213_2"></span>

        <p>We have come to the very end of Oden&rsquo;s dreams. Just one more day remained. On February 15, <span class="tooltip">#58<span class="tooltiptext ref58"></span></span> was sent, each line sent to a different discord channel. &ldquo;Gaol&rdquo; being another word for &ldquo;jail&rdquo;, this one spoke about the ancient times of the construction of the Ringed City. Some time later in the story, this poem also gave us an idea that Heart of Spears and Oden could have met before, as the general consensus became that Heart of Spears is the very first Spear of the Church. Why would he confront Oden for &ldquo;his dark mind&rdquo;? Perhaps Oden&rsquo;s dissatisfaction with the Age of Fire was so strong, he intended to wake\kill princess Filianore and undo the gods&rsquo; grand illusion.</p>
        <p>As a cute gesture, Raff has decided to write his own poem and send it to the Puppeteer:</p>
        <p style="text-align:center;">A hazardous path you’ve walked, my friend
            <br>Yet still, we cannot see the end
            <br>Through stitching sown sinew you’ve shown us a fight
            <br>But when will this challenge pass into the night?</p>
        <p>The Puppeteer was quick to respond with <span class="tooltip">#59<span class="tooltiptext ref59"></span></span>, which, again, was not a part of Oden&rsquo;s dream. He did, curiously, refer to himself as &ldquo;the end&rdquo; of the story (but no, we did not face &ldquo;The Puppeteer&rdquo; as the final boss).</p>
        <p>The very last poem of Oden&rsquo;s dream was sent on the same day and, fittingly, ended this segment of the story on a nice clean <span class="tooltip">#60<span class="tooltiptext ref60"></span></span>. An immediate continuation of <span class="tooltip">#59<span class="tooltiptext ref59"></span></span>, it speaks more about the confrontation between Oden and the &ldquo;slave firstborn of sunlit prison&rdquo;, which also became known as &ldquo;keeper first of secret last&rdquo;. An idea that Oden may have been the &ldquo;titan Lord of Thunder&rdquo; arose, since we know from <span class="tooltip">#27<span class="tooltiptext ref27"></span></span>, <span class="tooltip">#31<span class="tooltiptext ref31"></span></span>, and <span class="tooltip">#33<span class="tooltiptext ref33"></span></span> that Heart of Spears was put to rest by the aforementioned lord. The idea sounded good, but we were not sure it was the case just yet.</p>
        <p>And so, a fairly big chunk of exposition has ended. It was an interesting change of pace from the fairly frequent long in-game events, but it would also become boring if there were many more of these. Fortunately, this was not the case.</p>

        REREAD THIS OLD LORE SECTION WHEN POLISHING THIS CHAPTER:
        <h3>Cripple in Wonderlands - Slumber set analysis</h3>
        <p>After the event of 3 Feb 2018, Oden fell into deep, endless sleep (<span class="tooltip">#41<span class="tooltiptext ref41"></span></span>). The “Slumber Set” refers to the set of poems sent between 9 Feb and 15 Feb, describing Oden’s fragmented recollection of his own past.</p>
        <p>The first recollection we get to see starts with Oden, alone, wandering in haze. It could be interpreted as him observing the feverish dream-like state he is in.</p>
        <p>Oden is led to an unknown to him place by a frigid whisper. This was speculated to be the influence of Pontiff’s Eyes or the Small Doll, which leads you to Irithyll. It would make sense, as Oden the Armless became Slumbering Oden after being stitched together with the remnants of White Vagrant, who had strong connections to Irithyll.</p>
        <p>He questions whether he’s led to once more curse the golden rays. In light of more recent poems of Oden, Lord of Hail, it could be interpreted as cursing the old gods of Lordran and, more specifically, Gwyn. <span class="tooltip">#56<span class="tooltiptext ref56"></span></span> shows Oden literally cursing the Lord of Sunlight and his whole lineage.</p>
        <p>After a pause, Oden hears the bell bleed. This was speculated to be in some relation to Eleanora, as its Weapon Art produces a bell-ringing sound and gives the weapon a bleed buff. However, as of 31 Mar 2018, Eleanora has not been seen used by Lord of Hail nor of having any connections to him. More likely is that this refers to the bell at Archdragon Peak, where Lord of Hail was fought.</p>
        <p><span class="tooltip">#50<span class="tooltiptext ref50"></span></span> is not italicized, which suggests that this is not Oden’s PoV, but Father’s. He is talking about the giant, slumbering in the womb. To body of the giant was stitched and no longer has any place. The giant in question would be Oden (who out of all of the puppets had by far the largest frame). Slumbering in the womb suggests a rebirth of some sort. This symbolism was made clearer by the appearance of Lord of Hail, which is strongly suggested to be Oden being ’reborn’/awoken from his slumber.</p>
        <p>His mind, unfolding, shall soon bloom in hindsight is a clear precursor to Oden remembering more and more of his past in the following poems, ultimately returning to the world not as Slumbering Oden, but as Lord of Hail. It’s also worth noting that this is the only italicized line of the poem.</p>
        <p>Fanboy: So I was thinking about the lines &ldquo;his mind, unfolding, will soon bloom&rdquo; and &ldquo;for my clear eye was not forgiven&rdquo;. Assuming Oden is somehow linked to Pontiff, could this mean that he was at some point given one of the eyes that drive their holders mad (mind unfolding) but will be able to overcome its effects (mind will soon bloom). This was my initial idea, but then I checked some of the videos and he doesn&rsquo;t seem to fight in a savage manner, like the outrider knights.</p>
        <p>While he doth wander far from space seems to just be referring to the fact that Oden’s recollecting of the past is happening in the realm of dreams, not in the real physical world. Other interpretations include a sort of ‘mental ascension’</p>
        <p>Oden, the fearless cripple, was involved in a large-scale unorganized, chaotic battle (oh what a great, blood-thirsty mess…). All of his opponents withstood his offense, and raised their blades in retaliation.</p>
        <p>The next poem gives an idea that this large-scale brawl may have been during some event with participants from the Discord.</p>
        <p><span class="tooltip">#52<span class="tooltiptext ref52"></span></span> is talking about one of the very first appearances of Oden the Armless. Oden encountered and fought Seeker Valicarn (Nosferat’s character) on the rooftops in the Profaned Capital. Oden doesn’t seem too certain about him being a Cathedral Knight, perhaps due to his memory being hazy.</p>
        <p>At this point in time, the stage was set. It is unclear what this might be referring to.</p>
        <p>This has happened before the brawl described in <span class="tooltip">#51<span class="tooltiptext ref51"></span></span>, so it’s likely that these poems are describing the events in a reverse order, from most recent to most distant.</p>
        <p>Even before his appearance, Oden was hollowed, which could be interpreted as him being literally a hollow, or perhaps just extremely bored/having no purpose. At this dark time, a man found Oden. This man didn’t seem to be extraordinary, yet had a certain profaned ambition stirring up within him.</p>
        <p>One interpretation is that the man in question is Pontiff Sulyvahn, whose story also began in dark in the Painted World of Ariandel. As per Fanboy’s addition, the Profaned Greatsword description reads:
            <br>"Long ago, when Sulyvahn was yet a young sorcerer, he discovered the Profaned Capital and an unfading flame below a distant tundra of Irithyll, and a burning ambition took root within him."
            <br>
            <br>The choice of words profaned ambition seems very deliberate, and lines up very well with this description.
        </p>
        <p>Another possibility is that the man is the Father, and this is the point when he found Oden and made him his puppet. The later poems did reveal that Father has some plan in mind, which he was working towards (perhaps since the very beginning of the overarching event). <span class="tooltip">#88<span class="tooltiptext ref88"></span></span> suggests that this might even be something on the scale of the `end of the world` (to think that I&rsquo;m its epilogue to fill...).</p>
        <p>Oden recalls the darker days, perhaps even before the encounter with the man from the previous poem. Whether it was Pontiff or Father, second line seems to suggest that the man gave Oden his last purpose. NEED TO LOOK AT LORD’S POEMS FOR THIS.</p>
        <p>At this point in time, Oden was already old and crippled, which might refer to him already missing his arm.</p>
        <p> Terrid: A pontiff knight deserter who fights the effects of the eye rings? I dig it. Perhaps, he is armless because of something similar to Princess Mononoke where his arm is corrupted? Or he was undergoing the beastly transformation into what Vordt and Dancer are and removed his arm to stop said transformation</p>
        <p>The last line can be interpreted in several ways:
            <br>-          “I was doomed to fall and not forgiven because of my clear eye”. In this interpretation, Oden was doomed to fall, which was unrelated to his clear eye.
            <br>-          “I was doomed to fall because my clear eye wasn’t forgiven”. In this one, Oden was doomed specifically because his eye was unforgiven.
            <br>Either way you look at it, his clear eye was not forgiven. A clear eye might refer literally to one of his eyes having some supernatural power, but it’s more likely that it’s a metaphor for Oden seeing/understanding something he shouldn’t have.</p>
        <p>If we follow the idea of Oden being related to Pontiff and his knights, it could also be interpreted as him getting rid of one of Pontiff’s eyes, while the other one was already taking its toll. The Left eye also provides regen ability, which can be linked to Priscilla’s Lifehunt Scythe, which was a grave sin against the Gods and nature itself.
            <br>"Bewitched ring that Pontiff Sulyvahn bestowed upon his knights.
            <br>Knights who peer into the black orb are lured into battles of death, transformed into frenzied beasts. No wonder the Pontiff only provides these rings to those dispatched to foreign lands." (Description of Pontiff’s Eye Rings)
            <br>
            <br>"Scythe born from the soul of Priscilla, the stark white crossbreed trapped inside the painted world of Ariamis.
            <br>Even the Gods feared Priscilla&rsquo;s lifehunt ability, and in the hands of a mortal, its power will turn upon its wielder."
            <br>(Description of Lifehunt Scythe from DS1)
            <br>
            <br>"Aldrich dreamt as he slowly devoured the God of the Darkmoon. In this dream, he perceived the form of a young, pale girl in hiding."
            <br>(Description of Lifehunt Scythe from DS3)
        <p> The Priscilla was locked away in the Painted World of Ariamis, which became the base for the Painted World of Ariandel, which is where Pontiff originated from. This provides at least a vague connection between the Pontiff and Lifehunt Scythe.</p>
        <p>Given all of this, it is possible that Oden sought to obtain some sort of lifehunt/regen ability, perhaps to return his former youth and power (he is often referred to as old and crippled). This theory still holds up after receiving the Lord of Hail’s set of poems. If Oden was a lesser Lord from the times of Lordran, after living for centuries or even millennia past its downfall, he could have been seeking to return to his former level of power before going hollow and losing his purpose. On the other hand, <span class="tooltip">#84<span class="tooltiptext ref84"></span></span> calls the Lord of Hail’s strong appearance as a facade, “no great flame, but dying candle,” suggesting only a minor or superficial return of power.</p>
        <p>A fairly straight-forward curse towards Gwyn (the only character to ever be referred in the game as Lord of Sunlight) and his whole lineage. Here, and in the following poems of Oden (including the Lord of Hail’s set) we get a pretty clear image that Oden is openly against Gwyn and his doings.</p>
        <p>Feeble coward! Servant of thine fear! may refer to the fact that Gwyn linked the First Flame in fear of losing power, as the Age of Dark was coming closer and Age of Light was at its end. Did Oden see an alternative way to extend the Age of Light, or was he perhaps against the rule of Gods altogether?</p>
        <p>Another interesting detail is that Oden uses “Lord of Sunlight” to refer to Gwyn, instead of the “First Lord”. The former title was held by Gwyn only before linking the First Flame (afterwards he became known as Lord of Cinders), even before the events of DS1. This gives points to the idea that Oden has been around since the times of Lordran, which lines up with the idea of him being a surviving God.</p>
        <p>(Gaol is synonymous for “jail”)</p>
        <p>If we continue Ensign’s theory, this poem might be referring to Oden’s encounter with Heart of Spears: the sunlit prison is the Ringed City and Filianore, slave firstborn could be referring to the very first Spear of the Church, tasked to forever defend the princess from anyone who tries to wake her up.</p>
        <p>Dark mind also sounds fitting for Oden, as this is how his intentions would be seen by Gods whom he had opposed. It could even refer specifically to him desiring to wake/kill Filianore.</p>
        <p>The meaning of the last line is unclear, even if we assume the poem is about Heart of Spears from Oden’s point of view. What could Heart of Spears expect to find when encountering Oden? Him murdering Filinaore? Or his open opposition of the Gods?</p>
        <p>The final poem in the Slumber set, as indicated by the absence of trailing ellipses. This can be interpreted in light of the event with the death of Heart of Spears as the culmination of the encounter between Oden and the Heart, which was started in poem <span class="tooltip">#58<span class="tooltiptext ref58"></span></span>.</p>
        <p>Oden may have known the real name of Heart of Spears, as the one we know is definitely a title or a description, not a name. Nevertheless, he knows the name no more, suggesting that he either forgot it after living countless lifetimes, or specifically purged it from his memory for some reason.</p>
        <p>“Keeper first of secret last” sounds like a straightforward description of Heart of Spears, if we assume it’s the first Spear of the Church.</p>
        <p>We already have suspicions that Oden fought with Heart of Spears at some point, so HoS being the &ldquo;keeper&rdquo; could fit into our theories so far. Other thoughts that fit this interpretation are:
            <br>- The Spears of the Church guard Filianore&rsquo;s illusion--which is, in a way, &ldquo;keeping&rdquo; a secret.
            <br>- In a metaphorical sense, one keeps secrets in one&rsquo;s heart.
            <br>- We know from poem <span class="tooltip">#27<span class="tooltiptext ref27"></span></span> that HoS has been &ldquo;slumbering&rdquo; for a long time.
        </p>
        <p>The latter half of the poem is more convoluted. Oden and Heart of Spears fought for six nights, yet six nights afore, Heart of Spears fell in deep slumber, aghast. “Afore” is an archaic synonym for “before”, so at face value it means that Heart of Spears fought Oden while in a dreaming state. Another note is that he fell in said dream aghast, i.e. having been stricken with sudden, unexpected fear. Poem <span class="tooltip">#95<span class="tooltiptext ref95"></span></span> extends this train of thought, saying that Heart of Spears to dark was plunged in days forgone.</p>
        <p>This concludes the “Slumber set” of poems, which gave us a lot of insight into who Oden is and was.</p>
