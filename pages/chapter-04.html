            <br>Wraithflame Erik, Broken Vagrant,
            <br>Heart of Spears</p>

        <p><span class="versal versal-t">T</span>his event would become an important one in the story, as this is the first time we see what the Father himself is capable of. The four puppets were sustaining heavy damage during the last month. They may have been repaired accordingly, or left to withstand without Father&rsquo;s interference. However, the time came for Lone Darkwraith and Redflame Erik to be used for their intended purpose.</p>
        <p>With poem <span class="tooltip">#17<span class="tooltiptext ref17"></span></span>, the Father&rsquo;s work was revealed and the event began. There, in Demon Ruins, Wraithflame Erik awaited. <span class="tooltip">#19<span class="tooltiptext ref19"></span></span> tells us more about the abhorrent abomination - it&rsquo;s two living beings stitched together! The Father&rsquo;s intent from the start was to stitch them together, for then he would be able to extract something very important from them. But there is still plenty of time until we come to that point. For now, the Father is satisfied, for success in merging two creatures together has relieved him of his doubts.</p>
        <p>Wraithflame Erik used things from arsenals of both of its component puppets, along with several new items such as Firelink Greatsword and Power Within. The thing was self-destructive, as the two beings it originated from both still existed in one new body (this will be expanded upon in <span class="tooltip">#39<span class="tooltiptext ref39"></span></span>, <span class="tooltip">#66<span class="tooltiptext ref66"></span></span>, and during the very end in <span class="tooltip">#150<span class="tooltiptext ref150"></span></span>, <span class="tooltip">#152<span class="tooltiptext ref152"></span></span>). Frequent use of Power Within made it a dangerous opponent capable of quickly dealing lots of damage, and reckless playstyle only amplified that.</p>
        <p>Poem <span class="tooltip">#20<span class="tooltiptext ref20"></span></span> continues on <span class="tooltip">#19<span class="tooltiptext ref19"></span></span> (as seen by the symbols at the end). It refers to the current state of Redflame Erik and Lone Darkwraith as &ldquo;at last ascended&rdquo;, with three other puppets still awaiting a similar fate. And the discord members would be actively taking part until the very end. As an unrelated detail, bold characters from <span class="tooltip">#19<span class="tooltiptext ref19"></span></span> and <span class="tooltip">#20<span class="tooltiptext ref20"></span></span> spell out &ldquo;balance&rdquo;, which may be a reference to Narcolept&rsquo;s main character, who is named &ldquo;The Balance&rdquo;.</p>
        <p>Wraithflame Erik is also the first puppet to use custom Cheat Engine gestures - it sat in the Gravetender&rsquo;s pose before engaging its opponents.</p>
        <p>This would be the only event when Wraithflame would appear. His short-lived segment ended with poem <span class="tooltip">#21<span class="tooltiptext ref21"></span></span>, which also simultaneously started the second segment. You can watch all the footage collected from this segment below:</p>

        <span class="video" data-id="180127_0"></span>
        <span class="video" data-id="180127_1"></span>
        <span class="video" data-id="180127_2"></span>

        <p>The second segment revolved around the White Vagrant, which was not seen during the previous event. Apparently, the Father was unable to repair it. Showing hesitance in letting the discord members find the &ldquo;Spears&rsquo; forgotten hearts&rdquo; just yet, he decides to force Vagrant to fight in Yorshkaâ€™s church. Yet something goes wrong, and <span class="tooltip">#22<span class="tooltiptext ref22"></span></span> redirects us to the Cleansing Chapel.</p>

        <span class="video" data-id="180127_3"></span>

        <p>White Vagrant was severely damaged, and even had its name changed to &ldquo;Broken Vagrant&rdquo;. Fat-rolling and cripplede with misshapen limbs, Vagrant was actively suffering up to the moment it perished, as signified by <span class="tooltip">#23<span class="tooltiptext ref23"></span></span>, which is written from the puppet&rsquo;s perspective.</p>
        <p>We have ignored the AAAs which appeared from poem <span class="tooltip">#13<span class="tooltiptext ref13"></span></span> up to this point. As will be seen in the following two poems, they are the Vagrant&rsquo;s shrieks as it suffers from its continuously more ravaged state.</p>
        <p>Catpants tried to help the puppet by giving it Repair Powder, yet that did nothing. Eventually, the Vagrant started moving out of the Chapel towards the Cathedral, lying down in a jumbled pose in-between being invaded (presumably in the places where it was killed). Upon being found, it would struggle to get up with janky looking Cheat Engine animations.</p>
        <p>As it degraded ever further, poem <span class="tooltip">#24<span class="tooltiptext ref24"></span></span> told us that it had an unwavering resolve in the Father&rsquo;s overarching plan, and was willing to go through the painful death to advance it. After that, the puppet offered no more cohesive words or sentences, just shrieks that would all be combined together and saved as <span class="tooltip">#25<span class="tooltiptext ref25"></span></span>.</p>
        <p>As the Vagrant continued deep into the Cathedral, its condition worsened: the armor broke completely, limbs were misshapen even more, and it gained a constant poison debuff. Narcolept once found it atop the pile of misshapen bodies. It, nevertheless, made it all the way through the Cathedral, up to the Deacons of the Deep. At that point it lost the ability to even roll, and started fading away, first becoming a ghost-like thing that could not be locked on, then finally disappearing completely right before the boss room. Presumably, it was seeking the Doll to return to Irithyll, which is the area White Vagrant has been associated with.</p>

        <span class="video" data-id="180127_4"></span>

        <p>The Father seemed to have been completely fine with such a conclusion, as he talks about the Vagrant in <span class="tooltip">#26<span class="tooltiptext ref26"></span></span> as a bunch of spare parts that can be used later. This poem also start the last segment of this relatively big event, and perhaps the most memorable one - the appearance of the Heart of Spears.</p>
        <p><span class="tooltip">#26<span class="tooltiptext ref26"></span></span> gave out only the cryptic name, so the invaders following the event were left to wonder where the next puppet might be found. The connection to Spears of the Church was made very quickly (and as will be seen much later, it was a fairly deep connection), yet it took considerable time to actually find the Heart of Spears. Poem <span class="tooltip">#27<span class="tooltiptext ref27"></span></span> gave us the description of the yet-to-be-found puppet, revealing it to be much older than any of the ones we were facing so far. It also made a connection to the &ldquo;Lord of Thunder&rdquo;, by whom it &ldquo;by spear was stricken cyclopean&rdquo;. Because of that it was thought that there could be some connection to the Nameless King. Therefore, Archdragon Peak was checked.</p>
        <p>As the searching drew out, poem <span class="tooltip">#28<span class="tooltiptext ref28"></span></span> gave more clarifications, mentioning &ldquo;pygmys&rsquo; dust&rdquo;. This narrowed the suspicions down to the Ringed City, which is the only place we ever find pygmies outside of Ludleth. Shared Grave was checked, the area before the Spear of the Church bossfight was checked - nothing.</p>
        <p>Eventually the idea to check the Purging Monument arose. Narcolept was the first lucky one to succesfully invade the Heart of Spears. He made his way all the way from the Shared Grave, and found the Heart by the Monument.</p>

        <span class="video" data-id="180127_5"></span>

        <p>The striking unique feature of this puppet was, very obviously, the fact that it was impaled by Arstor&rsquo;s Spear through its heart. It also made use of unnaturally slim body proportions to hide surprisingly heavy armor with lots of poise. This allowed its Lucerne to trade with a lot of heavier weapons.</p>
        <p>Poems <span class="tooltip">#29<span class="tooltiptext ref29"></span></span> and <span class="tooltip">#30<span class="tooltiptext ref30"></span></span> were sent by the Puppeteer as more and more people fought the Heart of Spears. Expanding upon its lore, <span class="tooltip">#30<span class="tooltiptext ref30"></span></span> confirms that it was impaled specifically through the heart. Leaving the biology of how it is still alive aside (we are in Dark Souls after all), it is talked about as the most robust and powerful puppet that is currently known.</p>
        <p>Broken Vagrant has set a trend of breaking puppets down for parts, but poem <span class="tooltip">#31<span class="tooltiptext ref31"></span></span> (and later <span class="tooltip">#32<span class="tooltiptext ref32"></span></span>) laughingly shut the idea that we would be able to break Heart of Spears down. It also strengthened the connection between the Heart of Spears and the &ldquo;titan Lord&rdquo; it was enchained by. We eventually got to know who the &ldquo;titan Lord of Thunder&rdquo; was, but it will be left out for now for the sake of the narrative.</p>
        <p>Poem <span class="tooltip">#32<span class="tooltiptext ref32"></span></span> also gave some light on how the Father came upon the Heart of Spears. Apparently, he is old enough to have found it not long after the titan Lord put it to rest.</p>
        <p>As this huge event drew towards its conclusion, the Heart of Spears traversed the Ringed City all the way up to the Spear of the Church bossfight. There, Narcolept was beckoned with poem <span class="tooltip">#33<span class="tooltiptext ref33"></span></span>, as he did not invade after the first couple of times to let everyone else participate. What followed was an especially long fight between the two, &ldquo;fighting through all estus, divine blessings and 10 siegbraus&rdquo;. The recording of this fight can be seen below, as well as another fight with Ragg - another discord member.</p>

        <span class="video" data-id="180127_6"></span>
        <span class="video" data-id="180127_7"></span>

        <p>The event ended with poem <span class="tooltip">#34<span class="tooltiptext ref34"></span></span> shortly afterwards. It, again, gave a glimpse at the events that would go down in the near future: mainly at the fact that Wraithflame would be improved upon, and that there is another puppet that would need to be repaired. This would obviously be the White Vagrant, who was just broken down? No, no it wouldn&rsquo;t.</p>
