    <p><span class="versal versal-s">S</span>everal days later, a curiously short event took place. Not only that, but there was not a single poem sent in its duration.</p>
    <p>The Puppeteer sent a simple &ldquo;Cleansing Chapel 0000&rdquo; message at the start of the event. It was fairly obvious that this was a location and a password, so Ragg tried to put a Red Sign down at the Chapel. This was the correct course of action, and he was greeted by Nameless Flame.</p>

    <p>There were several noteworthy changes in the puppet. First of all, it now obtained a Humanity Head akin to Harald Legion knights from the Dreg Heap. Moreover, its spells were changes slightly. The weak invisible black orb was replaced with a slightly modified Black Serpent, and all of his spells gained an Unfaltering prayer variant.</p>
    <p>After several people got to fight the puppet, it disappeared without the Puppeteer announcing it in any way. The rest of the collected clips can be seen below:</p>
