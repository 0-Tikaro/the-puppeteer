        <p>White Vagrant is the very first puppet we have encountered, as it invaded the fight club on December 19th, 2017. Using a Murakumo and Pontiff Knight Curved Sword, it seemed to be be a character related to Irithyll. As we would learn throughout the story, the Vagrant was extremely weak-willed, but devoted to the Father&rsquo;s cause.</p>
        <p>It is also the very first puppet to die. During the event of January 27th, 2018, (about which you can read in <a href="chapter-04.html">Chapter IV</a>) it has been forced to keep fighting us despite being in horrible condition. This escalated to it breaking down completely, being degraded to a fading jumble of incoherent screams, broken bones, and crooked steel. It met its end near the boss-room in the Cathedral of the Deep, having traversed it despite being attacked constantly. A theory floated around that, despite ultimately being loyal to the Father, the desire to return to his homeland of Irithyll overpowered whatever feeling were making it obey the craftsman.</p>
        <p>Despite being the first one to disappear, White Vagrant played a fairly important role in the story. Oden the Armless was imbued with its fleeting soul, which allowed him to enter his deep slumber and ultimately reawaken as the Lord of Hail. It is also important to note that <span class="tooltip">#160<span class="tooltiptext ref160"></span></span>, which was sent during the Puppet&rsquo;s Journey, points at the White Vagrant being at least tangentially linked to the old gods and, likely, Gwynevere (&ldquo;...but soul had smelled of ancient sun.&rdquo;). This is likely the Puppeteer&rsquo;s way of justifying Oden recollecting his godhood after being imbued with White Vagrant&rsquo;s soul. <span class="tooltip">#160<span class="tooltiptext ref160"></span></span> also confirmed that this puppet originated in Irithyll, as it was sent when the Puppet was going through the Boreal Valley.</p>
        <p>It was also theorized that White Vagrant is meant to be a white phantom that has somehow lost the link to its original world, and so was left to wander between realms akin to the Vagrants from Dark Souls 1. There is, however, no solid proof or even mention of this in the Puppeteer&rsquo;s poems&mdash;rather it&rsquo;s a bit of our own lore-crafting.</p>

        <p>Oden the Armless was one of the "original" four puppets we have encountered near the beginning of the narrative. He appeared in various locations throughout the game, but seemed to mostly have an affinity for damp or decrepit places (but then again, which area in Dark Souls III isn&rsquo;t somehow derelict or fallen to ruin?). To be precise, he appeared in Undead Settlement, Crucifixion Woods, Cathedral of the Deep, Irithyll Dungeon, Profaned Capital, Untended Graves.</p>

        <p>Oden&rsquo;s most memorable visual feature is, of course, the missing arm. The character&rsquo;s in-game model had no left arm and the character itself never two-handed his weapons. As we later confirmed, this was done via Cheat Engine by setting the proportions of the limb to large negative values.</p>

        <p>As the narrative progressed, the character was merged with the remains of White Vagrant and entered a death-like sleeping state. Right before that we were able to face off against Slumbering Oden.</p>

        <p>After returning from his dream, Oden became known as Lord of Hail, having been shown to be a derelict god from the times of Lordran, stripped of his status and exiled after his assault of the Ringed City.

        <p>Lone Darkwraith was one of the "original" four puppets, alongside Oden the Armless, White Vagrant, and Redflame Erik. He appeared in the Cathedral of the Deep and, later on, in Irithyll</p>

        <p>There is very little we know of him in terms of lore, other than the fact that he is a remnant of the legion of Darkwraiths. For the sake of filling the gaps in the narrative, we can imagine that he was rotting away in some cell in Lothric, much like the Darkwraith enemy that drops the Red Eye Orb. The Father had, presumably, freed Lone Darkwraith and made him into his puppet.</p>

        <p>Shortly after the beginning of the narrative, Lone Darkwraith was stitched together with Redflame Erik into Wraithflame Erik.</p>

        <h4>Redflame Erik &mdash; the deranged pyromancer</h4>

        </table>

        <p>Redflame Erik was one of the "original" four puppets, alongside Oden the Armless, White Vagrant, and Lone Darkwraith. He appeared in Farron Keep, Demon Ruins, and the Cathedral of the Deep.</p>

        <p>Much like Lone Darkwraith, this character does not have a rich backstory. From what we know, he was a savage and likely fairly uneducated hunter (perhaps even a head-hunter?). At some point he attacked the Father but, for unknown reasons, have both failed the attack and also became a slave to the Father&rsquo;s plan.</p>

        <p>He was stitched with Lone Darkwraith into Wraithflame Erik and persisted inside that entity for a short while. As we know that Wraithflame has later been degraded into the Nameless Flame, the seedbed of Humanity, we can presume that Redflame Erik was an Undead.</p>



        <h4>Wraithflame Erik &mdash; the stitched abomination</h4>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <td>Firelink Greatsword<br>Hand Axe<br>Ringed Knight Straight Sword<br>Ringed Knight Spear<br>Dragonhead Shield<br>Power Within<br></td>

        </table>

        <p>Wraithflame Erik is the unstable, transient version of Nameless Flame which we have once encountered in Demon Ruins (you can read about the actual encounter in <a href="chapter-04.html">Chapter IV</a>). This creature is the result of the Father stitching together Lone Darkwraith and Redflame Erik in pursuit of obtaining a shred of Humanity.</p>

        <p>It&rsquo;s generally agreed upon that, within this entity, the minds of both Erik and the Darkwraith persisted, in some sense. And these minds were terribly enraged by the way the Father had treated them. Driven by their anguish, rage, and terror, they fought any creature which approached them with self-destructive abandon.</p>

        <p>Failing to separate themselves, their minds were ultimately broken down by the Father. No longer a completely sentient being, Wraithflame Erik was left in the dark silence of the Untended Graves, where it metamorphed into the Nameless Flame.</p>



        <h4>Heart of Spears &mdash; the ancient guardian</h4>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <td>Lucerne<br>Gotthard Twinswords<br>Golden Ritual Spear<br>Lightning Bundles<br></td>
                <td>Ruin Helm<br>Dragonscale Armor<br>Gundyr’s Gauntlets<br>Iron Dragonslayer/Lorian’s Leggings<br></td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <p>Heart of Spears is by general consensus one of the most memorable characters in the whole story.</p>
        <p>He first appeared as the explosive finale to the event described in <a href="chapter-04.html">Chapter IV</a>. His tall, lanky, but incredibly resilient carcass lay amidst its flowering rubble for many centuries. It is not known how much of his mind persisted through that stasis, it must have been at least partly hollow by the time we found it.</p>

        <p>The most striking feature of the character was a large spear sticking out through its ribcage and out near its head. Initially it was thought to be just a cool visual gimmick. But as the narrative unfolded it turned out to have a fair bit of significance. First we had learned that it was the "titan lord of Thunder" who had subdued the warrior with this very spear. Then, as Oden&rsquo;s dream took place and he regained his godhood, we have learned that the Oden was the lord of Thunder, and it was in his assault on the Ringed City many centuries ago that he confronted the Heart of Spears, the very first defender of Filianore. For seven days and seven nights they had fought, and in the culmination the Heart of Spears fell, and Oden himself was overpowered, stripped of his deific status, and sent into eternal exile.</p>

        <p>The defender had met its end by our hands, during the event described in <a href="chapter-12.html">Chapter XII</a>. After we banished what remained of its soul and its exhausted carcass collapsed amidst the piles of bones in the Ringed City&rsquo;s Shared Grave, the Father recovered it. And in the little cellar not far away from Irithyll, he restitched it, mended its ribcage from the gaping wound left by Oden&rsquo;s spear, and imbued it with the Humanity and the Lordsoul, the first being ripped away from the Nameless Flame, the second given willingly by Oden. Thus, it became the Puppet&mdash;the final child of the Father, and the key figure during the culmination of the narrative. And this Puppet&rsquo;s weapon of choice had become, of course, the spear which had pierced its own heart so many centuries ago.</p>



        <h4>Slumbering Oden &mdash; the wandering sage</h4>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <td>Zweihander<br>Wolf Knight Greatshield<br>Astora Greatsword<br>Partizan<br>Murakumo<br>Red Hilted Halberd<br>Firebombs<br></td>
                <td>Karla’s Pointed Hat<br>Exile Armor<br>Exile Gauntlets<br>Morne’s Leggings<br></td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <p>Slumbering Oden was a transition-character, much like Wraithflame Erik. He is the short period after Oden was imbued with the fleeting soul of White Vagrant, and fell into his great slumber. We encountered him once, during the event described in <a href="chapter-05.html">Chapter V</a>, immediately preceding Oden&rsquo;s Dream, which in turn is written-up in full details in <a href="chapter-07.html">Chapter VII</a>.</p>

        <p>Slumbering Oden very much resembles Oden the Armless visually, but his style of combat had changed dramatically. Imbued with the White Vagrant&rsquo;s soul, he regained his lost arm (or perhaps it was restored by the Father separately?), in which now rested a titanic black shield. Having gained a reliable means of defense, Oden did his best to lay waste with his Zweihander. But as the sleep took hold, he became more and more docile, falling asleep in-between our encounters and sometimes just outright ignoring us and sleepwalking.</p>
        <p>Oden inevitably fell into the shackles of his slumber, and we saw him for the last time in the Darkmoon Tomb, where he presumably slept until his mind and memories became fully restored. During this restoration we had learned that he was the titan lord of Thunder who had struck the first Spear of the Church down, and after which he was exiled and stripped of his godhood.</p>
        <p>Upon awakening, Slumbering Oden would become known as Lord of Hail&mdash;a transient spark, very much reminiscent of the titan Lord of Thunder.</p>



        <h4>Nameless Flame &mdash; the seedbed of Humanity</h4>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <td>Onyx Blade<br>Ringed Knight Straight Sword (onyx buff)<br>Ringed Knight Spear (onyx buff)<br></td>
                <td>Executioner Helm<br>Black Iron Armor<br>Black Iron Gauntlets<br>Morne’s Leggings<br></td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <p>The Nameless Flame is the culmination of Redflame Erik&rsquo;s and Lone Darkwraith&rsquo;s stories. The two poor undead, entangled in the webs of the Father, wound up stitched together into an abominable and enraged creature. Though sharing one body, their minds persisted as separate entities for a short period of time&mdash;the period when we encountered Wraithflame Erik.</p>
        <p>Yet shortly afterwards, the Father sent the poor thing away into the Untended Graves, where (either with the application of force or by the passage of time), both minds slowly deteriorated and merged together into something primal, subhuman. And that way, the Nameless Flame was born.</p>
        <p>The existence of this poor entity was the Father&rsquo;s hope for what may have been the most uncertain part of his plan of creating the Puppet. To create the suitable vessel for the First Flame, he required both the bright soul of a God, and the dark soul of a Man. The former he was certain to get from Oden, but the latter required some tinkering (it appears that in the Puppeteer&rsquo;s version of the world, the Humanity has become terribly scarce).</p>
        <p>The Nameless Flame was therefore created in an attempt to coalesce the shreds of Humanity from two undead and let it grow on the souls of its opponents.</p>
        <p>We have encountered the blackflame-wielding knight for the total of four times, with it changing slightly between them. The first three encounters were more-or-less standard, but the final one was more special. During the events described in <a href="chapter-09.html">Chapter IX</a>, we were ordered to break down the Nameless Flame and retrieve the Humanity, now fully matured, from its carcass.</p>
        <p>The knight fought against it, led on by the primal instincts still left somewhere within its mind, but ultimately was ravaged by the continuous onslaught. It began seeping Humanity, corrupting our own weapons with blackflame akin to the Onyx Blade, and clouding our minds. Eventually, it collapsed at the peak which overlooks the Dark Firelink Shrine. We ripped the cold flame of Humanity out of its mangled carcass, and presented it to the delighted Father.</p>



        <h4>Lord of Hail &mdash; the derelict god</h4>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <td>Astora Greatsword<br>Drakeblood Greatsword<br>Storm Curved Sword<br>Talisman<br></td>

            </tr>
        </table>
        <p>Lord of Hail is the culmination of Oden&rsquo;s story arc. From the start, the Father was likely aware of Oden&rsquo;s nebulous past, which was revealed to us only in short cryptic hints via the poems.</p>
        <p>In reality, Oden was neither unkindled, nor undead, but a full-fledged god. The deep slumber, into which he was put by the Father&rsquo;s manipulations with White Vagrant&rsquo;s soul, allowed him to slowly chip away the rust of hollowing which corrupted his mind throughout the centuries of his life.</p>
        <p>He recollected his first encounter with the Father, then his seething discontent with Lord Gwyn&rsquo;s cowardice, and at last his failed assault at the Ringed City. The latter culminated with him encountering the very first Spear of the Church&mdash;the Heart of Spears, and spending six days and six nights battling and ultimately overpowering him.</p>
        <p>We do not know why exactly his assault failed, but it failed nevertheless, and he was banished and likely stripped of his deific status.</p>
        <p>Now reawoken, Lord of Hail made a conscious decision to play a role in Father&rsquo;s grand plan to overthrow the Soul of Cinder and end the plague which was started by Gwyn, the First Lord. (He likely spoke with the Father about it, as seen in <span class="tooltip">#164<span class="tooltiptext ref164"></span></span>)</p>
        <p>Oden was aware that his own demise was short at hand, and that his powers as a god and as a living being were quickly failing him. He appeared before us twice, both times allowing for grand 6-people battles. Exhausted from his unending life, he then offered us the most precious thing he had&mdash;his Lordsoul.</p>
        <p>The Lordsoul was the final piece which the Father required to begin the construction of his last puppet.</p>


        <h4>The Puppet &mdash; the firekeeper</h4>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <td>Arstor’s Spear<br>Drakeblood Greatsword<br>+ All equipment of previous puppets<br></td>
                <td>Broken Lothric Knight Helm<br>Firelink Chestplate<br>Dancer’s Gauntlets<br>Dancer’s Leggings<br></td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <p>The Puppet is special in comparison to the other puppets we fought. It appeared only during the final event (chapters <a href="chapter-16.html">XVI</a>, <a href="chapter-17.html">XVII</a>, <a href="chapter-18.html">XVIII</a>, but has eclipsed all of the other opponents we have faced during the original run of the narrative.</p>
        <p>After the ravaging of the Nameless Flame, the banishment of Heart of Spear&rsquo;s soul, and the valiant self-sacrifice of Oden, Lord of Hail, the Father had obtained everything necessary to begin his craft.</p>
        <p>He carefully restitched and mended the hardy body left by the first Spear. First, he removed the now-overgrown, occult spear from its chest. Then, carefully, he encased it in armor which we ourselves were told to fetch him.</p>
        <p>When the body was ready, the Father let the Humanity and the Lordsoul mix together in some fashion which was never disclosed, and let the mixture pour into the Spear&rsquo;s repurposed carcass. In doing so, an unnatural, synthetic being came to life.</p>
        <p>The awoken thing was sentient and definitely had a mind of its own. It was, however, almost completely mute. The Father prepared it and escorted it to the High Wall of Lothric, where it would begin its singular journey.</p>
        <p>The Puppet&rsquo;s sole purpose was to overthrow the Soul of Cinder (the Great Old Sin, in the Puppeteer&rsquo;s world), and release the curse which Lord Gwyn put upon the world by prolonging the Age of Fire. To do so however, the Puppet would have to grow stronger, much stronger than whatever the Father could produce. Therefore, it was let loose upon the High Wall, with the quest to find and consume all of the remaining Lords of Cinder, as well as any other living creature that it would have encountered.</p>
        <p>And this was precisely what it did. During a journey which lasted for over twenty hours in real life and amounted for many months in-game, the Puppet wandered the realm, led on by the ever-growing hunger for souls, as its powers grew.</p>
        <p>As it consumed the Lords of Cinder, it was somehow altered, with the shreds of the First Flame coming into contact with its dual soul. The fundamental change was necessary if the Puppet was to combat and overpower the Soul of Cinder, for after the deed was done, it would have to consume the First Flame itself.</p>
        <p>The final Lord, the remnants of the royal family of Lothric, was ravaged and eaten, and the world slowly fell into deep cold silence as the Puppet made its way to the Kiln. There, along with five of us, beckoned into its world has helping spirits, it challenged the Soul of Cinder.</p>
        <p>After the deed was done, the Puppet consumed the Great Old Sin, and stripped the world of the warmth of the First Flame. It then marched on, its great deed done, until it came across the lonely cold Firelink Shrine, abandoned for its complete lack of purpose. There, it ascended the high tower with the bell which would never have to ring again. With the First Flame slowly beating inside its chest, it sat down and prepared itself for its eternal rest.</p>
        <p>And there it would forever, the last and eternal Firekeeper of the world. The road to the shrine would soon be washed away, forgotten by the people of the flameless world, and the First Flame therefore forever locked away, unable to influence the world any longer.</p>

        <p>The Ruinkeeper was supposed to be the fifth puppet in the original roster. This was actually the very first puppet I had designed, but sadly he never caught on with the audience. Some of the earlier poems referenced him, mainly <span class="tooltip">#10<span class="tooltiptext ref10"></span></span>. He was supposed to be a knight with a strong affinity for sunlight, hailing from the Ringed City. The linked poem was my attempt at bringing him back into the lore, but it did not work out as I wanted.</p>
        <p>He would later become the prototype for the Heart of Spears, which, in my personal opinion, turned out to be a much more intereching character.</p>
