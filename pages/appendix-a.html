        <p><span class="versal versal-t">T</span>his appendix holds short outtakes about all of the Puppeteer&rsquo;s puppets we have encountered throughout the game. <b>CAUTION - there are spoilers in this section.</b> We do not recommend reading anything here before you finish the main story.</p>

        <p><b>UNDER COSNTRUCTION</b></p>

        <h4>White Vagrant</h4>
        <p>White Vagrant is the very first puppet we have encountered, as it invaded the fight club on December 19th, 2017. Using a Murakumo and Pontiff Knight Curved Sword, it seemed to be be a character related to Irithyll. As we would learn throughout the story, the Vagrant was extremely weak-willed, but devoted to the Father&rsquo;s cause.</p>
        <p>It is also the very first puppet to die. During the event of January 27th, 2018, (about which you can read in <a href="#c180127">Chapter IV</a>) it has been forced to keep fighting us despite being in horrible condition. This escalated to it breaking down completely, being degraded to a fading jumble of incoherent screams, broken bones, and crooked steel. It met its end near the boss-room in the Cathedral of the Deep, having traversed it despite being attacked constantly. A theory floated around that, despite ultimately being loyal to the Father, the desire to return to his homeland of Irithyll overpowered whatever feeling were making it obey the craftsman.</p>
        <p>Despite being the first one to disappear, White Vagrant played a fairly important role in the story. Oden the Armless was imbued with its fleeting soul, which allowed him to enter his deep slumber and ultimately reawaken as the Lord of Hail. It is also important to note that <span class="tooltip">#160<span class="tooltiptext ref160"></span></span>, which was sent during the Puppet&rsquo;s Journey, points at the White Vagrant being at least tangentially linked to the old gods and, likely, Gwynevere (&ldquo;...but soul had smelled of ancient sun.&rdquo;). This is likely the Puppeteer&rsquo;s way of justifying Oden recollecting his godhood after being imbued with White Vagrant&rsquo;s soul. <span class="tooltip">#160<span class="tooltiptext ref160"></span></span> also confirmed that this puppet originated in Irithyll, as it was sent when the Puppet was going through the Boreal Valley.</p>
        <p>It was also theorized that White Vagrant is meant to be a white phantom that has somehow lost the link to its original world, and so was left to wander between realms akin to the Vagrants from Dark Souls 1. There is, however, no solid proof or even mention of this in the Puppeteer&rsquo;s poems&mdash;rather it&rsquo;s a bit of our own lore-crafting.</p>

        <h4>Oden the Armless</h4>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <td>Crystal Astora Greatsword<br>Crystal Partizan<br>Aquamarine Dagger<br></td>
                <td>Karla’s Pointed Hat<br>Millwood Armor<br>Gundyr’s Gauntlets (?)<br>Gundyr’s Leggings (?)<br></td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <p>Oden the Armless was one of the "original" four puppets we have encountered near the beginning of the narrative. He appeared in various locations throughout the game, but seemed to mostly have an affinity for damp or decrepit places (but then again, which area in Dark Souls III isn't somehow derelict or fallen to ruin?). To be precise, he appeared in Undead Settlement, Crucifixion Woods, Cathedral of the Deep, Irithyll Dungeon, Profaned Capital, Untended Graves.</p>

        <p>Oden's most memorable visual feature is, of course, the missing arm. The character's in-game model had no left arm and the character itself never two-handed his weapons. As we later confirmed, this was done via Cheat Engine by setting the proportions of the limb to large negative values.</p>

        <p>As the narrative progressed, the character was merged with the remains of White Vagrant and entered a death-like sleeping state. Right before that we were able to face off against Slumbering Oden.</p>

        <p>After returning from his dream, Oden became known as Lord of Hail, having been shown to be a derelict god from the times of Lordran, stripped of his status and exiled after his assault of the Ringed City.



        <h4>Lone Darkwraith</h4>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <td>Ringed Knight Straight Sword<br>Ringed Knight Spear<br>Dark Sword<br>Eastern Round Shield<br></td>
                <td>Dark Helm<br>Dark Armor<br>?<br>?<br><br><br></td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <p>Lone Darkwraith was one of the "original" four puppets, alongside Oden the Armless, White Vagrant, and Redflame Erik. He appeared in the Cathedral of the Deep and, later on, in Irithyll</p>

        <p>There is very little we know of him in terms of lore, other than the fact that he is a remnant of the legion of Darkwraiths. For the sake of filling the gaps in the narrative, we can imagine that he was rotting away in some cell in Lothric, much like the Darkwraith enemy that drops the Red Eye Orb. The Father had, presumably, freed Lone Darkwraith and made him into his puppet.</p>

        <p>Shortly after the beginning of the narrative, Lone Darkwraith was stitched together with Redflame Erik into Wraithflame Erik.</p>

        <h4>Redflame Erik</h4>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <td>Flamberge<br>Hand Axe<br>Demon’s Scar<br>Flame Fan<br>Fire Surge<br>Profaned Flame<br></td>
                <td>Executioner Helm<br>Slave Knight Armor<br>?<br>Morne’s Leggings (?)<br></td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <p>Redflame Erik was one of the "original" four puppets, alongside Oden the Armless, White Vagrant, and Lone Darkwraith. He appeared in Farron Keep, Demon Ruins, and the Cathedral of the Deep.</p>

        <p>Much like Lone Darkwraith, this character does not have a rich backstory. From what we know, he was a savage and likely fairly uneducated hunter (perhaps even a head-hunter?). At some point he attacked the Father but, for unknown reasons, have both failed the attack and also became a slave to the Father's plan.</p>

        <p>He was stitched with Lone Darkwraith into Wraithflame Erik and persisted inside that entity for a short while. As we know that Wraithflame has later been degraded into the Nameless Flame, the seedbed of Humanity, we can presume that Redflame Erik was an Undead.</p>



        <h4>Wraithflame Erik</h4>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <td>Firelink Greatsword<br>Hand Axe<br>Ringed Knight Straight Sword<br>Ringed Knight Spear<br>Dragonhead Shield<br>Power Within<br></td>
                <td>Executioner Helm<br>Firelink Armor<br>Gundyr’s Gauntlets<br>Iron Dragonslayer Leggings<br></td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <p>Wraithflame Erik is the unstable, transient version of Nameless Flame which we have once encountered in Demon Ruins. This creature is the result of the Father stitching together Lone Darkwraith and Redflame Erik in pursuit of obtaining a shred of Humanity.</p>

        <p>It's generally agreed that within this entity, the minds of both Erik and the Darkwraith somehow persisted, and were terribly enraged by the way the Father had treated them. In an attempt to manually separate themselves into two living creatures again, they were aggressive to the point of being self-destructive in combat.</p>

        <p>Failing to separate themselves, their minds were ultimately broken down by the Father. No longer a completely sentient being, Wraithflame Erik was left in the dark silence of the Untended Graves, where it metamorphed into the Nameless Flame.</p>



        <h4>Heart of Spears</h4>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <td>Lucerne<br>Gotthard Twinswords<br>Arstor’s Spear (technically?)<br>Golden Ritual Spear<br>Lightning Bundles<br></td>
                <td>Ruin Helm<br>Dragonscale Armor<br>Gundyr’s Gauntlets (?)<br>Iron Dragonslayer Leggings (?)<br></td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <h5>General speculations</h5>
        <p>- Is Heart of Spears the first Spear of the Church? So far there’s no robust evidence, but it would fit if we assume that in <span class="tooltip">#60<span class="tooltiptext ref60"></span></span> Oden talks about the Heart of Spears.
            <br>- Poem <span class="tooltip">#88<span class="tooltiptext ref88"></span></span>’s line, “chained by the Sun to coward&rsquo;s will…” appears to link Heart of Spears to Gwyn, likely being a servant of the Lord of Fire. <span class="tooltip">#93<span class="tooltiptext ref93"></span></span>’s line about “Father’s last vow” further confirms this idea.
            <br>- The idea that Heart of Spears is the first Spear of the Church seems all but confirmed by poem <span class="tooltip">#92<span class="tooltiptext ref92"></span></span>’s line that refers to it as “root of all Spears.” It is also enforced by <span class="tooltip">#93<span class="tooltiptext ref93"></span></span>’s line about resolving “Father’s last vow”
            <br>- Poem <span class="tooltip">#92<span class="tooltiptext ref92"></span></span> again discusses the fight between the “titan Lord” and the “root of all Spears,” and tells of its demise. Poems <span class="tooltip">#95<span class="tooltiptext ref95"></span></span> and <span class="tooltip">#96<span class="tooltiptext ref96"></span></span> seem to confirm its failure, mentioning that “To dark was plunged in days forgone,” and that “into sunlit ash it lands…”</p>

            <br>[#26 - #33] – Heart of Spears’ intro set
            <br>[#88 - #96] – Heart of Spear’s closing set
            <br>
            <br>Appeared in the Ringed City.
            <br>First appeared on 27 Jan 2018 near the Purging Monument. It later travelled to the base of Spear of the Church bossroom, which is the only place it was seen at afterwards.
            <br>
            <br>At 25 Feb 2018, Heart of Spears has appeared again, substantially more powerful. It boasted custom magic, consisting of modified Divine Fragment spears as well as custom Sunlight Spear, which would leave SotC spears in the air upon firing.
            <br>
            <br>At 30 Mar 2018, Heart of Spears appeared yet again, boasting the same custom magic as the encounter on 25 Feb. In addition, he gained a permanent lightning-buffed Golden Ritual Spear through which he casts this magic. He was able to use multiple lines of the Divine Fragments spears, unlike the normal one-line limit.
            <br>
            <br>As of 30 Mar 2018, Heart of Spears appears to be dead, as suggested by the poem #96, as well as his collapsed state in the Shared graves at the end of the event.. His death was accompanied by another image of an item:
            <br>
            <br>It is presumed that the remaining parts of Heart of Spears will be utilized in some form by the Puppeteer to make his final puppet.

            <br>
            <br>Appeared in Anor Londo.
            <br>First and only appearance on 3 Feb 2018. Uses several different weapon arts on his Zwei: Stomp, Neck Swipe, Spin Slash. All weapons deal heavy frostbite damage. At the end of his event, has fallen into deep slumber, from which he could no longer be woken. Shortly afterwards, he started sleep-talking(?), recollecting various events from his own past. For more details see “Oden: the Derelict Lord” in Speculations.
            <br>
            <br>As Oden appears to have been transformed back into his prior state, the Lord of Hail, it is presumed he will no longer appear in this form in future encounters.

            <br>
            <br>Appeared in Untended Graves, Cleansing Chapel, Great Belfry.
            <br>First appeared on 3 Feb 2018, using custom blackflame pyromancies and being the first true ‘miniboss’ of all of the puppets. Has seen a lot of use, being seen in a total of 4 separate events.
            <br>Last appeared on 10 Mar 2018, in an event where participants broke him in a fashion similar to White Vagrant. As a result, as mentioned in poem #70, the participants have extracted its soul, which can also be seen below:
            <br>
            <br>As of 17 Mar 2017, its use is uncertain. However, due to it being the only graphically visible “item” ever received by the participants, it’s like that it is of high importance.
            <br>
            <br>Is believed to be completely gone, and as such will not appear in the future. For more details see “Nameless Flame and its Parts” in Speculation. However, recent developments suggest that its soul will be used to create the Puppeteer’s final puppet.

        <p>Oden is the most lore-rich character in the Puppeteer’s lore so far. Incredibly old, predating the fall of Lordran, he is neither Undead nor Unkindled, but a God, surviving for centuries or even millennia.</p>
        <p>Oden has 4 major poem sets related to him:
            <br>[<span class="tooltip">#036<span class="tooltiptext ref036"></span></span> - <span class="tooltip">#042<span class="tooltiptext ref042"></span></span>] – Slumbering Oden’s intro set (Needs a write-up)

        </p>

        <h5>General speculations</h5>
        <p>- When Slumbering Oden was first introduced, we were told "Find him, wake the ancient thunder." (<span class="tooltip">#36<span class="tooltiptext ref36"></span></span>) Perhaps Oden is the “titan.Lord.of.Thunder”, and it is his spear that rests in the Heart of Spears.
            <br>- Unlike Wraithflame Erik, Slumbering Oden is not an equal combination of Oden the Armless and White Vagrant; he is Oden the Armless "refined" with a "new arm" taken from Vagrant&rsquo;s parts. (<span class="tooltip">#26<span class="tooltiptext ref26"></span></span>, <span class="tooltip">#37<span class="tooltiptext ref37"></span></span>, <span class="tooltip">#38<span class="tooltiptext ref38"></span></span>); heis almost always referred to in the singular, without direct mention of Vagrant.

            <br>- Oden the Armless used crystal weapons, while Vagrant used frostbite (and then, only on one weapon). Magic and frost are not opposites, and in fact often accompany one another (e.g. Snap Freeze, Friede's scythe), so there is no "balance" in this regard.
            <br>- Oden’s “mind, unfolding, shall soon bloom”. (<span class="tooltip">#50<span class="tooltiptext ref50"></span></span>) If he is the “titan Lord of Thunder”, perhaps his memories are hazy or lost, and he does not know who he is. But, if this is the case, it seems that being repaired with Vagrant’s parts may be enabling him to recall his past. (<span class="tooltip">#38<span class="tooltiptext ref38"></span></span>, “What ancient mind new arm did rouse?”)
            <br>- Oden blames the “Lord of Sunlight” (Gwyn?) for his downfall, (<span class="tooltip">#56<span class="tooltiptext ref56"></span></span>) why? Was he cast out by the Lord of Sunlight for some reason? Does it have anything to do with his missing arm?
            <br>- What is the relation between the “Lord of Thunder” and the “Lord of Sunlight”? If it is Oden’s (poisonous?) spear that pierced/became the Spears’ “noxious heart”, (<span class="tooltip">#26<span class="tooltiptext ref26"></span></span>) could Oden be referring to himself when he says the Lord of Sunlight’s “rotten lineage is blight”? (<span class="tooltip">#56<span class="tooltiptext ref56"></span></span>)
            <br>- Alternatively, “noxious heart” could be the puppet Heart of Spears itself. Is Heart of Spears a descendant of the Lord of Sunlight?
            <br>- Oden might be a lot older than we think. If Oden knows both Gwyn’s original title and the fact that he linked the First Flame (<span class="tooltip">#56<span class="tooltiptext ref56"></span></span>), it’s possible that he has been around since Lordran. (perhaps even before?)
            <br>- The slumbering series of poems appears to start off with Oden’s dreaming being mildly influenced by the parts of White Vagrant used to repair him. However, as Slumbering Oden was not a 50/50 composite of the 2 beings, Oden’s personality rapidly re-asserted itself, eventually even remembering his prior existence as the Lord of Hail.
            <br>- The combination of Armless Oden and White Vagrant might be the catalyst that finally allowed Oden to remember his true self. Wraithflame Erik, a being who was equal parts Erik and Darkwraith, is in a constant state of self-conflict, with both personalities constantly and vigorously trying to assert their sense of self while rejecting the other half.
            <br>- Slumbering Oden, however, was much more Oden than Vagrant. Similar to what happened with Wraithflame Erik, both parts of the being attempted to assert their personality after being stitched together with the same intensity as seen in Wraithflame; however, as Slumbering Oden is mostly Oden, the vestiges of Vagrant’s being were rapidly overtaken.
            <br>- The intensity of this process does not appear to stop until the being fully remembers itself, leading to Oden remembering his past as the Lord of Hail.
            <br>- The Lord of Hail appears to BE Oden, most likely his original form before he lost his arm. Poems <span class="tooltip">#71<span class="tooltiptext ref71"></span></span>-75 appear to have been heralding the rebirth of Oden in his original form, “the storm titan” known as the Lord of Hail. Poem <span class="tooltip">#81<span class="tooltiptext ref81"></span></span> probably confirms them to be the same being.
            <br>- If Oden is the Lord of Hail, poem <span class="tooltip">#80<span class="tooltiptext ref80"></span></span> confirms how ancient he actually is, as he speaks of “the First Lord’s fear” with some degree of familiarity. One of Oden’s dreams, <span class="tooltip">#56<span class="tooltiptext ref56"></span></span>, also seems to suggest his age.
            <br>- Poems <span class="tooltip">#56<span class="tooltiptext ref56"></span></span> and <span class="tooltip">#80<span class="tooltiptext ref80"></span></span> clearly establish that Hail/Oden are decidedly against Gwyn’s unnatural prolonging of the Age of Fire.
            <br>- Oden had to be restored to his former glory by repairing his lost arm, and then slumbering to remember who he once was, suggested by poem <span class="tooltip">#81<span class="tooltiptext ref81"></span></span>. This implies that Oden might even BE a god, especially when taken with the whole of poems <span class="tooltip">#76<span class="tooltiptext ref76"></span></span>, <span class="tooltip">#78<span class="tooltiptext ref78"></span></span> and <span class="tooltip">#79<span class="tooltiptext ref79"></span></span>.
            <br>- Lord of Hail is quite likely to be the “titan Lord of Thunder” spoken of in poems <span class="tooltip">#27<span class="tooltiptext ref27"></span></span>, <span class="tooltip">#31<span class="tooltiptext ref31"></span></span>, <span class="tooltip">#32<span class="tooltiptext ref32"></span></span>, and <span class="tooltip">#92<span class="tooltiptext ref92"></span></span>. This makes sense, as Oden/Lord of Hail and the aforementioned nameless lord both appear to be quite against the doings of Gwyn.
            <br>- If Heart of Spears is the first of the Spears of the Church, this would put the two in direct opposition to each other, as awakening Filianore would be a step towards undoing Gwyn’s work. This also puts poem <span class="tooltip">#60<span class="tooltiptext ref60"></span></span> into a brand new light, describing the confrontation between Lord of Hail and Heart of Spears.
            <br>- Poem <span class="tooltip">#95<span class="tooltiptext ref95"></span></span> seems to suggest that, after defeating the Heart of Spears, the Lord of Hail was successful in awakening Filianore, as it says that the Heart, “To dark was plunged in days forgone.” <span class="tooltip">#96<span class="tooltiptext ref96"></span></span> further reinforces this idea, with its line about the Heart states that “into sunlit ash it lands…”

            <br>[#71 - #84] – Lord of Hail’s intro set
            <br>
            <br>Appeared at Great Belfry, namely the Path of Dragon hill area.
            <br>First, and so far only, appearance on 18 Mar 2018. Character has very high health and seems to scale its health based on the number of invaders. Uses Neck Swipe on his Astora Greatsword, and Storm Ruler on his Drakeblood Greatsword. Uses 4 custom spells. The first is a gust of air that knocks his opponent down. The second is similar to the air gust, except has a small, flaming rock projectile that has a hitstun effect, even on an incomplete hit. The third spell is purely utility; he becomes intangible, plays the bonfire sound, then teleports to a set point (usually the center of the arena or the temple near the top of the hill). The fourth spell is similar to Nameless Flame’s tongues of flame, except it is a single sphere of what appears to be fierce winds.  Lord of Hail appears to fiercely defend this orb, focusing on anyone standing in or around the orb.
            <br>
            <br>The poems leading up to this encounter, as well as the poems during it, strongly suggest that Lord of Hail is Slumbering Oden, awoken from his sleep. For more details see “Oden: the derelict Lord” in Speculations.
