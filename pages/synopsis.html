        <br>
        <p><span class="versal versal-o">O</span>ur story begins with an old man. This man was not particularly interesting visually, nor was his past of much importance. Such a featureless figure he was that even his name escapes us&mdash;he was simply called <i>the Father.</i></p>
        <p>The man knew of the fate that awaited the stagnant realm of Lothric just as well as everyone else: Unkindled would rise up once again, beckoned by the ringing of the bell, to hunt down the Lords of Cinder and prolong the Age of Fire for just a little bit longer. It happened before, and it would happen again, unless some greater, more fundamental change came forth. Was the Age of Fire not a clinging disease, plaguing the realm from eons forgotten? The Father believed so. But what could he change? He was neither a warrior, scholar, nor a cleric possessing the strength to mend all of the damage alone. Yet he was not helpless. Having amassed profound amounts of knowledge in his considerable age, the Father was a craftsman of a very peculiar sort&mdash;he operated with sinews and souls, and the products of his craft were living beings.</p>
        <p>In his pursuit to cleanse Lothric of its stagnant plague, he had brought together four puppets: White Vagrant&mdash;a meek, lost spirit; Lone Darkwraith&mdash;a derelict of a long perished cult; Redflame Erik&mdash;an insane, bloodthirsty pyromaniac; and Oden the Armless&mdash;a towering cripple hailing from some distant, forgotten age. The four fought under the Father&rsquo;s guidance, and, in return, the Father mended their wounds and gave them shelter.</p>
        <p>White Vagrant came from Irithyll. Caught in the craftsman&rsquo;s webs, the poor thing lost the link to its own world and was forced to wander aimlessly between realms. Its remaining wills were quickly broken, and they submitted to the Father.</p>
        <p>Not much can be said about the Darkwraith. Once a member of the fearsome legion, where were all his brothers now? Rotting away in putrid dungeons, or wearily sneaking about the gloomy forests. This one, too, was likely imprisoned somewhere in Lothric. That is, until the nimble fingers of the lonely nameless man removed his chains and cuffed him in different, far stronger ones.</p>
        <p>The Redflame of the Forests was a fearsome man, borne through many battles by sharp instincts, but never by an intelligent mind. In his wanderings through the sickly swamps of Farron Keep, he came across a rugged figure sitting by the bonfire. As he came closer, thoughts of the most terrifying nature flooded his primitive mind. We know not what he did, but we do know that, in the end, the pyromancer became a puppet all the same.</p>
        <p>And at last, there was Oden. The Father had found him in a dungeon deep below the surface, where he was hollowing away in his unending wanderings. The cripple&rsquo;s titanic frame was crowned by an old rugged hat like those of the wizards and witches. And a wizard he was, in a certain way, for he survived many bloody battles while having just one arm! But it wasn&rsquo;t this extraordinary expertise that piqued the Father&rsquo;s interest in this aged man. Something proud and noble peeked though the weathered skin of his face. Some unyielding clarity, hidden away behind the murky eyes.</p>
        <p>The four were all war-minded, and for the better&mdash;no other language would be so universally understood amidst the ruined heap of Lothric&rsquo;s rubble? They may have targeted everyone, or maybe just our small congregation of travelers. We didn&rsquo;t know who they were or what they wanted. At first we were confused, then intrigued, and then excited, for we never knew just how far the strings stretched which made these puppets move. But, step by step, string by string, the Father&rsquo;s plan came together in front of us, and at once we were inseparable from it.</p>
