        <p><span class="versal versal-n">N</span>ow, where do we begin? At the beginning, of course. Our story begins with just a single man. His looks held nothing special, nor is his past of much importance. Such a featureless figure he was, that even his name escapes us&mdash;indeed, he was called simply <i>the Father.</i></p>
        <p>The man knew of the fate that awaited the stagnant realm of Lothric just as well as everyone else: Unkindled rise up, beckoned by the ringing of a bell, to hunt down the Lords of Cinders and prolong the Age of Fire for just a little bit longer. It has happened before, and it would keep on happening, unless some greater, more fundamental change came forth. Was the Age of Fire not a clinging disease, plaguing the realm from eons forgotten? The Father believed so. Yet what could he change? He was neither a warrior, scholar, nor a cleric possessing the strength to mend all of the damage alone. Yet he was not helpless. You see, the Father, diligent in his age, was a craftsman of a very peculiar sort&mdash;crafting neither trinkets nor weapons, but living beings.</p>
        <p>In his pursuit to cleanse Lothric from the Age&rsquo;s plague, he had stitched up four puppets: White Vagrant&mdash;a meek, lost thing; Lone Darkwraith&mdash;a derelict of a long perished cult; Redflame Erik&mdash;an insane, bloodthirsty pyromaniac; and Oden the Armless - a towering cripple, within whom slumber some vague, distant relics. And for a while it was so: the four fought for the Father, and, in return, he stitched their wounds and gave them shelter.</p>
        <p>None were made from scratch. White Vagrant came from Irithyll. Entangled in the craftsman&rsquo;s strings, he forever lost the link to its own world, and resigned to wander aimlessly between realms. The Vagrant&rsquo;s remaining wills were quickly broken, and in the end he submitted to the Father&rsquo;s guidance.</p>
        <p>Not much can be said about the Darkwraith. Once a member of the fearsome legion, where were all his brothers now? Rotting away in the putrid pits of the castle. This one, too, was likely imprisoned somewhere in Lothric. That is, until the nimble fingers of the lonely nameless man removed his chains and cuffed him in different, far stronger ones.</p>
        <p>The Redflame was a savage, borne through the battles by his great experience, but not by an intelligent mind. In his wanderings through the sickly swamps of Farron Keep, he once came across the Father. As he found the man, terrifying thoughts crashed down on him. We do not know how that encounter resolved, but we do know that Erik became a puppet all the same. What was it that scared the pyromaniac so much, I wonder?</p>
        <p>And at last, there was Oden. Just as the others, the Father found him in some dungeon, hollowing away in his unending wanderings. Cripple&rsquo;s titanic frame was crowned by an old rugged hat like those of the wizards and witches. And a wizard he was, in a certain way, for he survived many bloody battles while having just one arm! But it wasn&rsquo;t this extraordinary expertise that piked the Father&rsquo;s interest in this aged man. Something noble and proud peaked through his weathered facade, and the craftsman saw it at once.</p>
        <p>All four were gathered, and the Father was ready to begin on his meticulously prepared plan. The four were all war-minded, and for the better&mdash;what other language do people understand in the ruined heap of rubble that is today&rsquo;s Lothric? They may have targeted everyone, or maybe our small congregation was somehow special&mdash;that we will never know. But we met them, one by one. At first we were confused, then intrigued, and then excited, for we never knew just how far the strings stretched which made the skillful puppets move.</p>
        <p>The man himself never pulled his veil down. And that is to be expected: what was he, a craftsman of such occult kind, to do with our hoard of bloody plunderers? But piece by piece, string by string, his grand plan came together in front of us, and at once we were an integral part of it.</p>
