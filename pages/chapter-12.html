        <p><span class="versal versal-o">O</span>n the last Friday of the month, we were to witness the final event for one of the most beloved puppets&mdash;the Heart of Spears.</p>
        <p>Poem <span class="tooltip">#91<span class="tooltiptext ref91"></span></span> kicked things off early on in the day. The Father&rsquo;s lamenting over the sorry state of the world is yet again reinforced, as is his terminating role in its story. As we were getting closer and closer to the final act of the story, the Puppeteer has been making this increasingly clear&mdash;we all knew the end was coming soon.</p>
        <p>Later on in the day, <span class="tooltip">#92<span class="tooltiptext ref92"></span></span> announced the beginning of the event and gave us a clear goal to fulfill (in the same way poem <span class="tooltip">#63<span class="tooltiptext ref63"></span></span> urged us to harvest the Humanity from the Nameless Flame). The &ldquo;sunlit vessel&rdquo; would become a metaphor for the Heart&rsquo;s corpse from here on onwards, and will be strengthened even more at the end of the event.</p>
        <p>Not by coincidence, what we would bring back today was directly related to said Humanity&mdash;&ldquo;the forceful light of life pitch-black, it matters not without a frame.&rdquo; As we already know from <span class="tooltip">#68<span class="tooltiptext ref68"></span></span>, in the Puppeteer&rsquo;s story Humanity is the source of life much in the same way the Souls are. Yet just a raw shard of it cannot manifest itself into anything useful&mdash;it needs a corpse to animate.</p>
        <p><span class="tooltip">#93<span class="tooltiptext ref93"></span></span> gave an obvious clue as to the location we were to search in: &ldquo;the streets of gold&rdquo; is a direct description of the Ringed City. Moreover, this is the only place Heart of Spears had been seen. And just as expected, we had found it:</p>

        <span class="video" data-id="180330_0"></span>

        <p>Soon after invading the Heart, we realized that one thing would be different this time. Just as <span class="tooltip">#90<span class="tooltiptext ref90"></span></span> said, the Heart would &ldquo;wander&rdquo; away from the Halflight boss fog. Where to? We did not know yet, but the fact that it was slowly moving was obvious.</p>

        <span class="video" data-id="180330_1"></span>

        <p>As several of us pointed out, the Heart had also become more aggressive and rabid in comparison to previous appearances.</p>
        <p>Poem <span class="tooltip">#94<span class="tooltiptext ref94"></span></span> continues the Father&rsquo;s wondering. The Heart is undoubtedly ancient, having lived through the foundation of the Spears of the Church. Was it by chance the founder of it? The previous poems, such as <span class="tooltip">#58<span class="tooltiptext ref58"></span></span> and <span class="tooltip">#60<span class="tooltiptext ref60"></span></span>, strongly suggest that it&rsquo;s the <b>first</b> Spear, but is it also the driving force behind the covenant? We would never get an answer, nevertheless it&rsquo;s an interesting idea.</p>
        <p>The poem also mentions the Heart&rsquo;s dream. <span class="tooltip">#27<span class="tooltiptext ref27"></span></span>, which introduced the puppet, had also mentioned it waking from its slumber. The dream seems to have been not like Oden&rsquo;s Dream of recollection, but a more severe one akin to death. We know that it was induced by the titan Lord by impaling the puppet through its chest with the &ldquo;cyclopean spear&rdquo;.</p>
        <p>Another note&mdash;there is an overarching theme of &ldquo;great beings fallen out of grace&rdquo; in the Heart of Spears, Oden, and all of the initial puppets as well. Certainly makes the story fit the Dark Souls universe, which is also known for the same motif.</p>

        <span class="video" data-id="180330_2"></span>

        <p>As the event went on, and the puppet reached Gwyn&rsquo;s statue in the Ringed City, poem <span class="tooltip">#95<span class="tooltiptext ref95"></span></span> was dropped. The Father recollects what we already saw in <span class="tooltip">#60<span class="tooltiptext ref60"></span></span> from another perspective. The first Spear of the Church was with no doubt a mighty and ferocious being of great renown. And ever yet, this fearless, strong, sunlit creature was forcibly reduced to an unmoving corpse by the titan Lord.</p>
        <p>(Stepping slightly off-topic: We are certain that the &ldquo;titan Lord&rdquo; is Oden, Lord of Hail. The recurring mentions of how he overpowered the Heart of Spears suggest that he was a frightfully strong being as well, during that ancient period.)</p>
        <p>And ever still, perhaps because it laid dead for eons or just by virtue of the passage of time, the Heart&rsquo;s soul and mind have been reduced to fading scraps. Poems <span class="tooltip">#96<span class="tooltiptext ref96"></span></span> and <span class="tooltip">#97<span class="tooltiptext ref97"></span></span>, sent in quick succession, urged us to void its corpse from them.</p>
        <p>There are a couple of interesting points in these last poems. Starting with <span class="tooltip">#96<span class="tooltiptext ref96"></span></span>, it mentions &ldquo;last Father&rsquo;s vow&rdquo;. What does it precisely mean? From <span class="tooltip">#32<span class="tooltiptext ref32"></span></span> we know that the Father had &ldquo;made sure&rdquo; the Heart would remain dormant until his plan was advanced enough. It could refer to the Heart&rsquo;s corpse being the last &ldquo;real&rdquo; resource the Father needed for his plan. As we know from <span class="tooltip">#82<span class="tooltiptext ref82"></span></span>, Oden, Lord of Hail offering himself as a sacrifice for the Father is only a matter of time now, so obtaining the Heart&rsquo;s corpse would be the only step that still had to be made.</p>
        <p>As Ensign pointed out, <span class="tooltip">#97<span class="tooltiptext ref97"></span></span> has a cute wordplay at the very end. A &ldquo;light mare&rdquo; could refer to the wanderings of the Heart, as it daydreams throughout this whole event, recollecting the zenith of its life during its last fleeting moments. Not the worst way to go, but certainly not the best either.</p>

        <span class="video" data-id="180330_3"></span>

        <p>The Heart wandered on along the Midir&rsquo;s bridge, and into the Shared Grave. Our hunch was that it was going towards the Purging Monument&mdash;the very first place where it was found, and also the place for resurrecting Spears of the Church.</p>
        <p>During the last fight of the event, <span class="tooltip">#98<span class="tooltiptext ref98"></span></span> was the last bits of lore we would ever get on the Heart of Spears. Again it references the Heart&rsquo;s death-like dream, and at last we get a glimpse of its nature. The dream was that of the Abyss, likely indicating that the titan Lord of Thunder possessed\nurtured within himself an affinity for the dark. Or, which is perhaps more likely as indicated by <span class="tooltip">#31<span class="tooltiptext ref31"></span></span>, the Lord&rsquo;s cyclopean spear was likely imbued with potent occult powers. The Heart, having always existed in the bright sunlight of the Gods, had a great weakness to this wholly opposite force.</p>
        <p>The puppet, torn, tired, and broken, found its eternal respite in the deep chamber of the Shared Grave. There we found it motionless and mangled. The Father was, undoubtedly, content, as we saw in the closing poem <span class="tooltip">#99<span class="tooltiptext ref99"></span></span>.</p>

        <span class="video" data-id="180330_4"></span>

        <p>Along with the final poem, we found the Vessel, which is, supposedly, how the Puppeteer decided to show Heart&rsquo;s corpse in the form of an item. Much like the Humanity, this was a precious resources for the Father, and a reward for us. (Technically speaking, the Vessel is a modification of the Basin of Vows from vanilla DS3)</p>

        <img src="../assets/images/180330_vessel.png" data-action="zoom"/>

        <p>And so, the Heart of Spears was no more. With Humanity and the Vessel obtained, and Oden&rsquo;s submission being just a matter of time, we have stepped on the straight path to the finale of the Puppeteer&rsquo;s story, which had by now become an important part of our community. Several people have even said out loud that it was a highlight of their Dark Souls experience.</p>
        <p>In a manner befitting such sentiments, <span class="tooltip">#100<span class="tooltiptext ref100"></span></span> talks about the Father&rsquo;s philosophy and of his grand plan. Caught in the endless cycles of Fire and Dark, simply bringing upon the next Age would do nothing in the grand scheme of things. And so the Father knows&mdash;to &ldquo;make sure our prints for eons last&rdquo;, a different, more fundamental change to the world must be made.</p>
