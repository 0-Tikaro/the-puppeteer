            <br>Heart of Spears</p>

        <p><span class="versal versal-h">H</span>eart of Spears continued Nameless Flame&rsquo;s trend of hosting events in silence. This time, Jean and Narcolept got peculiar personal messages from the Puppeteer: &ldquo;0010 1.&rdquo; and &ldquo;0010 2.&rdquo; respectively. In addition to the text, both were sent the following screenshot, showing Heart of Spears sitting on top of a flower bed in the Ringed City:</p>

        <img src="assets/images/180225_heart_of_spears.jpg" data-action="zoom"/>

        <p>By now we have figured out that if there was ever a binary password sent, the Puppeteer expected red signs. Narcolept quickly threw his down where the Heart of Spears was last seen, and was promptly summoned.</p>
        <p>What followed was a fight with new, improved Heart of Spears. Visually it stayed very similar to its first appearance, the only notable change being Iron Dragonslayer Leggings being replaced with Lorian&rsquo;s (we suspect it was to add the stylish cape). One weapon was added - a Golden Ritual Spear with a constant orange lightning buff, which is most likely the buff from the Dragonslayer Swordspear. The real improvement was the addition of two custom spells to the puppet&rsquo;s arsenal, elevating it from a regular character to a miniboss.</p>
        <p>The spells both utilized Spear Fragment&rsquo;s lightning spears (which we&rsquo;ll refer to as &ldquo;Fragment&rsquo;s Spears&rdquo;, else this paragraph would get really messy). This reinforced the idea that Heart of Spears was previously a Spear of the Church (moreover, as brought up during Oden&rsquo;s dream, it&rsquo;s likely to be the very first Spear of the Church). First spell spawned a line of Spear Fragment&rsquo;s Spears the same way a regular Spear Fragment would. The difference being that it had no cooldown, which meant that Heart of Spears was capable of quickly gaining control over the environment. The second spell was a modified Sunlight Spear, which spawned several Fragment&rsquo;s Spears on launch. While they did not do a lot of damage, this modification proved itself valuable, as it shut down anyone trying to roll through the Sunlight Spear to get very close to the Puppet.</p>

        <p>Same as during the Nameless Flame&rsquo;s events, the Puppeteer gave everyone present a couple of fights before disappearing. You can see a couple more recorded fights below:</p>

        <span class="video" data-id="180225_1"></span>
        <span class="video" data-id="180225_2"></span>

        <p>New, improved version of Heart of Spears appeared. The Puppeteer did not send any poems, instead DM&rsquo;ing Narc and Jean with an in-game screenshot, picturing the Heart of Spears resting near a broken statue in the Ringed City. It&rsquo;s worth noting that Narc&rsquo;s screenshot was labeled &ldquo;2.&rdquo;, and Jean&rsquo;s &ldquo;1.&rdquo;. The meaning of that is unknown.</p>
        <p>Discord members put their signs down by the Spear of the Church bossfog, and Heart of Spears summoned them to fight.</p>
