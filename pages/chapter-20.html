        <p><span class="versal versal-a">A</span>nd so, the story came to a conclusion. After five months of mystery and excitement, my players and I were left with great memories, and I myself with a whole bunch of information to sort, organize, and rewrite.</p>
        <p>In this final chapter, I have collected some final throughts of the participants (note: they were gathered before anyone was aware about me being the Puppeteer), as well as my own little commentary on the whole thing:</p>
        <span class="quote">
            <p><b>qy:</b> The Puppeteer was the most memorable PvP experience that I&rsquo;ve had in a game. It was amazing to watch as a cryptic narrative unfolded before us, and to participate in the in-game events it spawned. It&rsquo;s really a special thing to have a player who takes tools used for cheating and instead using them to enrich the experiences of others, and the Puppeteer executed it perfectly. I&rsquo;ll never forget it.</p>
        </span>
        <span class="quote">
            <p><b>Raff:</b> Thanks to Tikaro for managing the document for us. It was too much of a hassle to record many of the events, but rest assured I was there for many of them. This has been the highlight of the server in my eyes, and I couldn&rsquo;t have asked for anything better. Peace y&rsquo;all.</p>
        </span>
        <span class="quote">
            <p><b>Fanboy:</b> Encountering the Puppeteer as late as it happened during DS3’s life cycle was a true blessing. When I joined the SL90 server, for which he crafted his story, the game was already 2 years old. Most of what could have been squeezed out of the game… had probably been squeezed out. It was very difficult to come up with something new. Despite this, the Puppeteer delivered to us an amazing, cryptic tale in true Soulsborne fashion, spanning across several months.
            <p>From everything I saw during this time, I can without a doubt say that the Puppeteer has an incredible creative mind, and a beastly work ethic. Just some of the things that showcase this are: the CE usage and the intensive testing that must have gone into it. The images he made in Photoshop, which some of the community members described as “professional-like”. The poems and riddles thrown our way, which we tried to decipher while waiting for his next appearance in-game. The music choices to which the final puppet would act, and the PvP skill needed to pull it off… Obviously, none of this could have been done if said person did not absolutely love the game, or perhaps even the whole series.</p>
            <p>The finale, the DF run through the game, left me and many others physically and emotionally drained. We stayed up into the early hours of the morning for several days straight, just to see the ending that was made for us… and also had to deal with saying goodbye to one of our beloved community members. The latter hit me very hard during the last hour-and-a-half or so of the event, just as the final boss fights began. I had to remove myself from VC because I was brought to tears, for I knew we would most likely not meet again.</p>
            <p>Thank you for this experience, the memories of which I will continue to treasure.</p>

            <p><b>Nosferat:</b> The Puppeteer&hellip; where do I begin?
            <p>At the beginning, I suppose. I first met the Puppeteer during my Dried Finger run traveling through Farron Swamp, the ruins to be specific. I would go on to find him both in the Cathedral and in Catacombs, though he disappeared when I went further into the game. My first thought was that he was a random invader coming back to invade hosts, as during the time there was a sale going on, then again, he was SL90, so I figured it must&rsquo;ve been a themed invader from the discord.</p>
            <p>But later, I would meet him again in Profaned Capital, I was amazed and surprised about all these new invaders stepping through the shadows, it breathed life into the game for me, at a time where I was feeling quite weathered. Oden The Armless: his appearance, demeanor, his playful banter&mdash;I loved all of it, even despite the typical Europe/Australia connection issues.</p>
            <p>A day or so later after encountering him I would receive several friend requests from one account, I figured it was hatemail or something similar, so I didn&rsquo;t accept it. I am never going to live that one down, with the knowledge I am armed with currently.</p>
            <p>It was mind blowing, it was exciting. There are things that the Puppeteer did that made me wish they were in the original game in the first place, the lore was interesting and new, his puppets were all unique and equally fun to fight, to beat, to lose against. When the Puppeteer did his infamous Dried Finger run, I stayed up all night (the runs would start at 2am my time) just to catch him, because I was that addicted to playing with/against him, to learning the story, to the banter with fellow SL90 members.</p>
            <p>Everything about what had happened helped me grow both as a person and as a player. The Dried Finger sniping, the events that transpired, the co-invasions, his very own Dried Finger run, none of it was lacking and if I had the chance to go back&hellip; I would do it all over again and gladly so. My only regret was not participating more, and even one such as me knows that all good things must come to an end.</p>
            <p>Closing thoughts? Thank you, whoever you may be. Whoever it was that had this crazy idea that may or may not have gotten way out of hand but it turned out absolutely for the better. I will never forget this, so long as I live. Thanks Puppy, and no collapsing. <img class="emoji" src="../assets/images/emojis/lipp.png"/></p>

            <p><b>Noxuary:</b> I&rsquo;ve made a lot of amazing memories playing the Dark Souls series, however the best of all are thanks to the community. I&rsquo;ve met so many great people, and made so many friends through these games. Amazing people who inspired my creativity and entertained me with theirs, who hosted amazing events that I only ever dreamed of participating in. The Puppeteer is the greatest example of this. Even though it feels like so much time has passed, I still don&rsquo;t feel like I&rsquo;m able to find the words to express how I felt about what he created. He created a whole world and gave us a glimpse into it. I&rsquo;d always wanted to fight a CE miniboss, but this was so much more than that. I wasn&rsquo;t in a very good place at the time, so I&rsquo;ll always regret how much of these events I squandered, how much of it I missed, and how poorly I played. However, I&rsquo;ll still never forget the sheer wonder I felt when I first encountered him, and the overwhelming satisfaction I felt when I first defeated him, and every time after that as well. I remember getting lost in the lore of his world for hours, eventually inspiring me to try my hand at writing some of my own.</p>
            <p>I sincerely wish I could go back and do it all over again, not just to right my wrongs, but to have those same feelings again.</p>
            <p>I have no doubt I&rsquo;ll eventually forget my fun little memories I have from playing, but I know I&rsquo;ll never forget the people I met along the way.</p>

            <p><b>Tikaro:</b> As some of us, including myself, began to ebb away from Dark Souls III, it means a lot to know that this story, which began simply as me messing around with an alternative Steam account, turned into a legitimate memorable experience for my players.
            You know, this whole think started as just me messing around with an alternative Steam account. I wanted to add a bit of excitement into our small community, and didn&rsquo;t have any idea it would end up as the massive roleplaying extravaganza that it became. It means a lot to me to know that my players enjoyed the experience and appreciated the novelty that it brought.</p>
            <p>I loved every second of running the story: preparing the lore, tinkering with Cheat Engine to see what new unique thing I could bring for the next puppet. Slowly building up the excitement for the long grueling journey of the final event, and then running it and seeing how my players reacted&mdash;it was all fantastic. I am of two minds about how long I had to pretend to not be the Puppeteer (I arguably didn&rsquo;t do a very good job of it at some points, haha). The mystery behind the “man pulling the strings” was very important to me, but I believe I overdid it.</p>
            <p>As for you, the reader of this story, I hope that I made you experience the excitement that me and my players felt. And, along with that, I hope that I inspired you to do something interesting yourself.</p>
