FIX SANDWORM BEING BIGGER THAN IN THE GAME. IT'S NOT
>>> We didn’t mention it yet, but the first Twtich blackground for this area was showing the Puppet fighting against the Carthus Sandworm, which appears to be a bit larger than the one we face in-game.

//////////////////////////////////
About the father:
He possessed neither godhood nor god-like powers of Lords of Cinders. He was a man (which we are sure of because Oden himself called the Father a <i>wight</i> in #109---which means <i>a human being</i>.

//////////////////////////////////

After the break, the Puppet headed to the Grand archives:


#186+
Last apparition still to feed
whom yielded flesh for monster mute.
To its homeland no roads yet lead -
one cannot go without a route.


Here, he had new spells that utilized the particle/visual effects of those used by Lothric, younger prince. These included small darts and large explosions of light. At the beginning of the area, the Puppet used the Arstor-Drakeblood combo. The damage seemed to have increased yet again, as some people found themselves mercilessly struck down in mere three blows, should they fail to find an opportunity to heal. Passing through the archives, the Puppeteer posted:


#187+
Corpse given to the voiceless knight
holds not the tale of Spears sublime.
Yet in these halls of white sunlight -
a different tale of ancient crime.


At the top of the archives, the weaponry was changed once more: the Puppet now was rocking the combo of Lucerne and Gotthards. Defeated one final time on the way to the Twin Princes boss fog, red signs were requested:


#188+
Amalgam of the sunlit prison
along with feathers airy and white.
Your signs awaits image arisen,
from knight enduring fevered light.


In the boss fight, the Puppet used gold pine bundles to push the damage even further. By this point, the spells Lothric used were becoming larger and larger in size. One more challenger was beckoned in a familiar way:


#189+
Fake imitation of the old
won't dare take up more time.
Just over here, last Lord so cold,
the last banquet of this great climb.

1 LEFT


After the final battle here, we were told to move on to the Kiln of the First Flame…


#190+
Our goal is clear, for we are done.
No lords or souls are left to eat.
Great Sin of Old, your time has come!
This hellish knight will do the feat.

#191+
You, blood-hungry hunters of the world
endured such journey with us two!
Come with it now, and stand so bold
along the hellspawn. See it through!

Here, something unexpected happened. We were summoned ALONGSIDE the Puppet to combat the Soul of Cinder in a 5v1 engagement. Having absorbed its soul, the fight was followed up by a similar one… 5v1s against the now-strengthened Puppet:

#192+
INTO THICK ASH THE PIECES FALL
STRONG JAW SUBDUES THE BLAZING HEAD
WORLD'S FLAME WILL NOT STAND TALL
AS KNIGHT ENGULFS ITS FINAL SHRED


Multiple times, five people were summoned. Multiple times, we killed the Puppet. Yet every time, it stood back up, becoming stronger, faster. In fights, the Puppet began to deal massive damage, enough to two-shot almost any given opponent, while moving with an enormous speed. He also seemed to acquire passive hyper armor as some attacks did not make him flinch at all. The fights required a decent amount of co-operation from the discorders, as not to hit one another, while also covering those under attack. Finally, one last battle was indicated to occur:


#193+
AS SKY GROWS DARK IN ENDLESS NIGHT
ONE SPARK IS LEFT, UNTAMED AND BRIGHT
COME EACH ONE NOW, FOR FINAL FIGHT
SOON ENDLESS REST WILL TAKE THE KNIGHT.

1 LEFT


With the final group of five managing to defeat the Puppet, it was finally over. The months-long journey was complete:


#194+
This world, old and decayed,
it now, alas, no one controls.
Left standing is one richest shade
of the Darkest of Souls.


But it was not over. Not yet. Once more, we returned to the Untended graves, where we had one final set of showdowns, via red sign summons To preserve the impact of these fights, we will not be documenting anything here – please watch the videos, for which we will hopefully be able to acquire the music the Puppeteer played in the background. For some, the emotional impact was… enormous.

Eventually, the Puppeteer announced that the invaders would be given one last attempt to fight. Asked to provide a name, Fanboy spoke up, naming his character, Valerie of Carim – which was accepted by a couple others as a fitting final opponent for the Puppet.

After the fight, we were instructed to place our red signs one final time, but now not for a fight… again, what transpired here will not be documented in text to preserve the impact – please watch the videos.

Content with the results of all of his work over the past several months, the Puppeteer posted one final poem…




#195+
Knight takes a seat under dark bell,
great deed is done, the embers fade.
It now shall rest, enchain the hell
till even time itself will fade.


-THE END-


Following which, he finally broke character completely, letting us have a Q&A session regards to, well, anything related to the project and him… if you want to read our questions and the Puppeteer’s answers, please check out the Puppeteer-related channel on the SL90 discord, #01010000.
