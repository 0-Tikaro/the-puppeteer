An hour before 4PM GMT, the Puppeteer had once again begun the countdown. Our excitement was no doubt rising, seeing just how massive and engaging the last day's event was, and knowing that a lot was still left in the game.

As the countown reached zero, poem #155 announced the Puppet's awakening. Judging by its contents, the half a day of rest was not calm or beneficial to the mute knight. It went on "unfeeling" from its "exhausting" slumber. It may be alluding to the Puppeteer's real-life state, as the event has (and would still) undoubtedly take a toll on his immediate well-being. In-game, it may be referring to the absolute mess that was the Puppet's mind and soul---a conglomeration of different beings fueled by unrelenting hunger and infused with so many living souls.

Seeing how the Puppet was resting inside Wolnir's tomb, where yesterday it fought off the last waves of invaders, we were expecting it to proceed to Irithyll. The Puppeteer, however, chose a different route---we were to descend into the Smouldering Lake.

The Puppet quickly traversed the long stretches of lukewarm water, and came down into the Demon Ruins. We were to search for it in this ancient maze riddled with half-dead hell-spawns. The Mad King's weapon art would sometimes be heard echoing somewhere near where the Puppet was, adding to the atmosphere.

Unlike many areas before it, we faced a regular Puppet inside the ruins: using only its familiar Arstor's Spear and Drakeblood Greatsword, along with their custom weapon arts. This is the state in which Fanboy, who was one of the first ones to successfully fight it, found the knight.

Yet the apparent normality would soon be broken, as poem #156 warned us. The Puppet was carefully constructed by the Father, and its very core was made of the Humanity's flame and the Lord Soul "entwined into the formless grey" (#128). Yet inside that unnatural mixtures lay all the dead puppets we faced in the span of the last five months. We have fought Lone Darkwraith's apparition in the Cathedral of the Deep, Redflame Erik's mirage in the Farron Keep, and what could be described as Soul of Cinders' intrusive presence in the Catacombs. There was only one puppet which was seen in the Smouldering Lake - Wraithflame Erik.

A curious side-note: #156 sheds some more light on Wraithflame's state. Whatever was left of it, it was "engulfed in wrath". We can theorize that it was just as enraged about its poor fate during its only event at the end of January (which, if you need a refresh, is described in chapter four: LINK LINK LINK #c180127 Ashes and Stitches LINK LINK LINK). The poem also pokes fun at the Father with the last line: "Whose cruel hand sealed such a fate?". As we've seen throughout the whole story, the Father is far from being a good man. He is not perfectly evil either, rather a neutral character who is also ready to do abhorrent things in the name of his goal. Even if it meant condemning two living beings to spend the end of their lives as an abominable amalgamation.
