The long-awaited day has come. The culmination of the most prominent event if the whole story was upon us. We were excited, but also undeniably sad: the end of the story would go hand-in-hand with the Puppeteer's disappearance.

During this event, he gradually built up very active interactions with all of us. On the first day, they mainly manifested themselves in occasional emote usage. On the second day, he would listen to our occasional requests and responding to them. On this final day, he joined our voice-chat channel in Discord. While he stayed mute through the whole finale, this allowed him to listen to us experience his final work as closely as possible.

The twilight of the Puppet had begun, as it came down from the storming ruins of Archdragon Peak. As rested as such an artificial unliving being could be, it marched on through Irithyll Dungeon's neglected halls, arriving in the ruins of the Profaned Capital.

It would be here where we would get the final conclusion on the long story of Oden. We have learned of his ancient past as a Lord of Thunder and later Lord of Hail. We saw how he was reinvigorated by his last Slumber. Now, we would once more see the quickly-fading facade of the unimportant hollow vagabond---Oden the Armless.

#176 set the gears into motion, as the Puppet was overcome by yet another apparition. This poem, to no surprise, spoke of the armless wandered in what we have learned to be his darkest times, (which is solidified by #53 and #54 of his slumber).

The Capital's poems will add just a bit more concreteness atop the already fairly clear story that we have constructed around Oden. We know he was adherent of the Dark, or rather he was an adversary of the Fire. This distaste, in many ways similare to the Father's, has moved him to actions which culminated in his assault of the Ringed City. There, he fought the Heart of Spears for six days and six nights. The Heart of Spears was subdued, its heart pierced by Oden's occult spear.

Yet something went wrong---Oden failed in his assault. Perhaps the encounter left him exhausted, and he was overpowered by whatever other forces were left in the city. The cause doesn't matter much, the result does: Oden, the titan Lord of Thunder, was stripped of his godhood and exiled by the gods of Lordran.

For uncountable years he would be condemned to wander the earth, eventually finding his way to the lands of Lothric. Despite his titanic failure, something of the nobility befitting his origin remained in him, for as Oden fought invaders and hosts deep in the putrid depths of the Dungeon and the Capital, he was still "resolute" (third line of #176).

Yet it's not a far-fetched idea that his past haunted him, for the very same poem describes him as being "on the run". On the run from what? The gods of Lordran have perished so long ago even the legends about them are slowly being forgotten. And what else could this living relic of antiquity possibly fear?

As the Puppet walked through the same places Oden once fought Nosferat in, it mimicked and adopted the towering cripple to the point of also missing an arm. Seeing how that arm would be back in the very next area, it can hardly be tied into the lore as anything but another little homage to what made Oden's first iteration unique.

What the Puppet did adopt was cripple's magic arsenal, though before the boss-fight it consisted only of the Aquamarine Dagger.

This allows us to bring up another curious point. Oden appeared in three wildly different forms, and each was heavily reliant on a single type of elemental damage. Oden the Armless made heavy use of magic-infused weaponry. Slumbering Oden was coated in a layer of frostbite. Lord of Hail's greatsword struck with lightning, and his spells revolved around storm.

This is curious because none of the characters, aside from the Puppet, have made such leaps in magic affinity. As of now we don't have a good explanation as to why this is the case with Oden. Perhaps it's nothing more than the Puppeteer deciding to use Oden to explore a lot of ideas. Perhaps it could be extrapolated that Oden had a natural affinity for various types of magic. The latter idea could have some credit since the character is based on the norse god Odin, who was well-known for his feverous pursuit of all kinds of magical knowledge and wisdom.

Poem #177 tied the final ribbon on Oden's. In his steady pursuit of what he thought was true, he went against his entire race, because he believed their reasoning to be blind with fear. He was a traitor for a cause that was nobel from his point of view. He suffered for his choices. And yet, in the very end, he likely found peace in knowing that there was someone else, potentially more powerful than he was, working towards the same goal. With that thought, Oden, the titan Lord of Thunder, the Lord of Hail, the Armless, vanished from the stage.

He may have disappeared, but his vague recollections still echoed inside the Puppet's fragmented mind. As the capital was searched, its last inhabitants consumed for souls, the mute knight approached the large throne room where another tormented lord awaited.

In a fitting manner, the very last setup we saw of Oden was also the very first one we have ever encountered. This boss-fight was very down-to-earth: no custom spells were used, no weird tricks played. Just the temporarily armless Puppet and one of us, duking it out as Yhorm the Giant sat silently and watched.

This did not make for a boring encounter, for the Puppet was aggressive and invasive in its play-style. It was especially ferocious with the Aquamarine Dagger. The weapon's great strength lies in long comboes it can produce. The Puppet's enormous stamina pool synergized perfectly with it, since a regular character quickly gets exhausted when swinging this thing.

This is also the fight that produced one of several Puppeteer memes: at some point when either waiting to be teleported into the arena or just after a fight, Narcolept collapsed. The Puppeteer responded with a fairly non-chalant "<i>no collapsing</i>". Many found the timing of the response humorous, and so it stuck around as an inside joke even half a year after the Puppeteer was gone.

#178 was a herald of doom for Yhorm. The giant wasn't removed from the boss arena, instead being a static observer of the fights that went down in his hall. "Poor sufferer" likely refers to Yhorm's actual in-game lore, for his story is one of heavy sacrifices for his people.

Noxuary was the last one to fall, with a quick back-and-forth showing yet another way the Puppeteer began interacting with us on this final day:

[7:35 PM] noxuary: alright, blackguard nox sign is down
[7:36 PM] Jean: Where, now?
[7:36 PM] The Puppeteer: :no_entry_sign: The capital stands deserted
[7:36 PM] Jean: You flee, now?
[7:36 PM] The Puppeteer: yes
[7:36 PM] Jean: Still a good way to say it
[7:37 PM] noxuary: darn

All of his out-of-character comments were italicized (not to be confused with Oden's speech though, all the lore was communicated exclusively via poems).

The final poem of the area served as a prelude to the next place the Puppet was to desolate. #179, as you may see, is bold. Having fended off all of us---weathered invaders out for its blood---and banished Oden's final apparition from its mind, the Puppet was prepared for another feast. It's a grotesque thought experiment to try to imagine just how "Lord dead and gone in gaping maw" must have looked like. The gruesome imagery of a Puppet literally tearing the souls apart with its teeth only reinforces the primal feeling the Puppet gave off. Yet again we were reminded---it's not a living creature in the fullest sense.
