Advancing deeper into the fight, the flamberge would be changed to the Demon's Scar, which moved from a mere off-hand to a main-hand weapon. The Puppet was extremely aggressive during the entire fight, with the constant pressure added from Fire Surge and Profaned Flame in tandem with everything already in its arsenal. If this was not enough, Dragonhead Shield would be brought up.

We have persevered through Erik's challenge. As its apparition was consumed by the Puppet, it sought after its next prey - they Abyss Watchers. After #150 was sent, Fanboy successfully finished Erik's apparition off.

The Abyss Watchers were a very important target for the Puppet. They were already once sacrificed to the First Flame, and, by extension, were a part of the Great Old Sin. The artificial knight was growing ever stronger in is journey,as we fell 55 times in total. Yet, just our Unkindled souls would not suffice if it were to overthrow the Sin. No, the thing would need to consume those much more powerfulâ€”the Lords of Cinder.

A feast was to be held. The Watchers, evidently, fell, and their soul lay barren in front of the Puppet. #151 tells us all we need to know. In some grotesque way that is never spoken of in details, the synthetic knight has devoured the sublime soul. And with it---a taste of what Great Old Sin possessed. (And a little detail: all of the poems sent in the Catacombs would be bold. This will become a trend for all the areas immediately succeeding the Puppet devouring a Lord of Cinders).

With each and every soul the mute puppet has consumed, it grew ever slightly stronger. But the soul of a Lord would not be equal to the soul of a mere Unkindled or less. While it would be traversing the decrepit Catacombs, it would find the soul engulfing its arms outside just as it was scorching its mind inside.

Its right hand weapon now gained a special fire effect, different from the regular Charcoal Resin. Moreover, its Spear now gained a yet another weapon art - the Mad King's Folly. And ever still, the Puppet could now use more than one Golden Soul to regenerate its health. It's presumed, but not confirmed, that it could use no more than two souls now.

Emboldened by the "blazing thunder" of the Lord of Cinder's soul, the Puppet could now be invaded by as many as four people at once! No doubt it would prove to be a challenge for both the participants and the Puppeteer himself. Especially for the Puppeteer: as he would later confirm to be based in Europe, it was certainly past midnight, with the event spanning more than 8 consecutive hours with just one break.

It was also discovered that the Puppet was not a fan of fighting near ledges:

But ever still, the mute knight kept fighting, and despite many of us standing in its way, it kept moving. Through the upper Catacombs, past the dangerous stairway guarded by the skeleton ball. Eventually, it made its way to the bonfire.

Eventually, the knight reached Wolnir. We have no idea whether it got rid of him before or after turning back to faces us for the last time. Either way, #152 told us that the the time has come for the usual ritualistic feeding of the Puppet. We were once again to willingly offer our souls to it, in return for bloody combat.

The arena was curious: it wasn't the dark grotto you find Wolnir in, but rather the preceeding room with the goblet. Here, we would face the Puppet using the same things it had to manage 3v1 or even 4v1 scenarios---only now it was a duel. This proved a challenge for many of us. Moreover, there was a yet new mechanic unique to this bossfight: the Puppet would, as far as we could tell, be able to teleport! It wasn't the same type of teleporting Lord of Hail utilized though. The Puppet would get out of sight, hiding behind numerous pillars. Then, as we approached the place we presumed it to be, it would reappear in some other distant corner of the room.

As became the Puppeteer's usual tact---once all active participants got a fight or two against the Puppet, #153 announced there would be just one more fight.

As the last foe fell, synthetic knight's kill count rose to a neat 60. Simultaneously, poem #154 gave a proper finish for this event. The Puppet was unfeeling, mute, 'dead' for all intents and purposes. Yet it too needed rest. And so did everyone involved---a nine hour event has just ended, yet merely a third of what the Puppeteer promised us for this grand finale. Tomorrow, we would see him again, and witness the second third of the Puppet's Journey.
