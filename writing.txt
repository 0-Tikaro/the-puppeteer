UNTENDED GRAVES

Mute knight's slow march, passing by Consumed King's Gardens, has led us towards the Untended Graves---the only side-path of the game still unexplored. Now voided of the Sin's radiant blaze, the Puppet was ready to descend into pitch blackness.

Here the penultimate apparition took over the Puppet's mind. Undoubtedly one of Father's greatest creations, and perhaps the second most-fun-to-fight puppet---the Nameless Flame's transient spark was upon us.

The Puppet, its head gone in a black miasma akin to that of the desecrated Harald Legion knights, awaited its opponents by the broken vessel in the center of the area. The way the bulk of the area played out was awfully similar to our very first encounter with the Nameless Flame all the way back in the beginning of February. The Puppet utilized the humanity-seedbed's full arsenal: Onyx Blade, Ringed Knight Straight Sword and Spear, all augmented with the blackflame weapon buff. Alongside the wide melee array, the mute knight also mimicked Nameless Flame's blackflame pyromancies. Quick and relentless fights were had all throughout the area.

Yet time passed us by in a flash, and after just a couple of us have gotten our fill of the blackened Puppet, the boss fog was approached. #183 beckoned us in, per the usual rules.

    Boss theme: Alex Roe - In Death, I Am Reborn

Immediately you see that this boss fight was unique in comparison to all the other ones we've had so far. It's certainly worth bringing up that most of the fights held here were two-on-one instead of the usual one-on-one scenario. But what has given the fight its real flavor was the location the participants were brought into. Gundyr's plain and boring arena was completely ignored in favor of what immediately succeeded it---the ascent into the Untended Firelink Shrine. Its varied terrain gave the Puppet a narrow enough corridor to ascend towards the shrine while simultaneously fighting off two invaders <i>and several Black Knights</i>, which were swiftly brought into our carnage.

All this would have made for a fairly interesting boss-fight already, but there's one more thing that made this one into something special. At the time of gathering footage, the only available clip of this fight was that of Fanboy, where the fight has ended prematurely, courtesy of the Puppeteer's particular adoration of pits and ledges. But later on, Nosferat and Narcolept have shared their own footage from the depths of their hard drives. In them we can see what this last "thing" is: after successfully fending off the invaders and the Black Knights, the Puppet entered into the shrine and forced us along with it. To fight our epic adversary inside what is arguably the most important location of the game, which is also completely inaccessible for online---and all of this with Alex Roe's <i>In Death, I Am Reborn</i> on the background? What a recipe for a memorable encounter.

#184 brought this incredible fight to an end, as the Nameless Flame's apparition was swallowed up by the Puppet's hunger. It's worth noting that there was nothing said of the blackflame puppet during this whole encounter. Perhaps the Puppeteer has thought that everything that was worth saying about it was already said.

The poem paints a clear picture of the mute knight: its armor warm from the blazing Lord of Cinders-like soul within, it forces itself out of the black miasma of Humanity, and walks wearily away from the flameless Shrine. Up the cliffs of the Untended Graves, over poisonous mud of the degraded Gardens and through the still sterile halls of Lothric Castle, until at last it stands before the doors of the Grand Archives.

Here it takes a sit by the bonfire and rests for half an hour, the Puppeteer announcing it with #185 (and likely frantically running to the toilet and grabbing a bite of something in real life).
