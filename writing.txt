Yhorm the Giant has fallen, and Father&rsquo;s creation has consumed its third Lord. As we were taught to expect, this meant that the Puppet would be engulfed by the Soul of Cinder&rsquo;s flames for the next area.

The prediction was correct. Shortly, Twitch background has shown the Puppet beginning its assault at the last bastion of the world of Dark Souls 3&mdash;the Lothric Castle.

Along with the twitch image, the Father has spelled out for us the grim fate the Puppet was facing. Through #180 we have learned of two things. From the end of Chapter XVI up until this moment, this written interpretation of the events made no distinction between the times the Puppet was overcome by a surfacing apparition of one of the Father&rsquo;s old puppets, or by the raging souls of Lords of Cinders. But this poem makes it clear: infernal blaze of Great Old Sin is not a transient memory. With the consumption of the third Lord, the Puppet&rsquo;s own soul has crossed the point of no return, which was tangentially heralded by #169, in the depths of Irithyll Dungeon.

It&rsquo;s also worth noting that the Father refers to his marionette as a &ldquo;hollow thing&rdquo;. It may mean that the mute knight is indeed &ldquo;hollow&rdquo; in the Dark Souls sense of the word&mdash;that it is technically not truly dead, but also persisting only on basic instincts rather than sophisticated thoguht. It may also mean that the Puppet is physically hollow on the inside&mdash;being a vessel of sorts, continously being filled by the souls it consumes on its arduous journey.

Dissapointingly for both of us, very little information is actually preserved from this part of the Puppeteer&rsquo;s Dried Finger run. Due to a unprecedented purge of our footage from Streamable (which is a service many of us used to share in-game clips), no footage from this area, besides the boss fight, survived. Nevertheless, we can reconstruct the events down to decent details, and use our imagination to fill in the gaps.

The Puppet, engulfed by Sin&rsquo;s raging flames, assaulted the Lothric Castle and disposed of Dancer of the Boreal Valley. It then immediately marched onwards, ignoring Consumed King&rsquo;s Gardens for the time being. Pulled forward by the nagging of its one and only purpose, it fought through the waves of Lothric Knights mixed with us&mdash;the invaders.

Each time the Puppet has consumed a Lord and was enflamed by Sin, it grew more powerful. The Abyss Watchers left it feeble and miserable, despite enhancing its accursed spear. Aldrich, along with the remnants of Gwyndolin, gave birth to two special pyromancies as well as further enchancing its main weapon. Now, Yhorm&rsquo;s hellish soul has coated both of Puppet&rsquo;s weapons in its flames, and added a third pyromancy to its arsenal. The pyromancy was a mix between a Farron Dart and Seething Chaos: a quick flick of knight&rsquo;s arm threw down a mine which would explode violently after several seconds. Large explosion radius already made Seething Chaos a good tool for crowd-control, and quick animations allowed to render large areas dangerous. (Though there is one note for that: as seen in the boss clip and during the later areas of the event, no matter how many Seething Chaos mines were thrown down, only two would explode. This is likely a limitation on the game&rsquo;s part that the Puppeteer had overlooked.)

The Puppet&rsquo;s growing powers would have allowed it to demolish the area extremely quickly, were it not for us. Summoning limits were unlocked once again, and up to <b>five</b> of us were able to hunt the mute knight simultaneously. By a lucky remark left in the discord chat, we know that at one point the Puppet was facing an insurmountable challenge of attempting to defeat five fully-healed invaders, buffed by the Lothric Priests&rsquo; Sacred Oath (which, if you are unaware, is more potent than the regular Sacred Oath). The Puppet, despite now being a lot more powerful than a legitimate character, fell short of that, and was forced back to a bonfire.

Eventually, the mute knight has sterilized the lower floors of the towering castle. Inescapable as a force of nature, it disposed of the Pilgrim Butterfly which was controlled the Dragonslayer Armor and beckoned us to the bridge. #181 invokes an idea that at this moment, the Puppet was at the zenith of its power as of this part of the journey. No longer degenerated into a meek thing by the Great Old Sin&rsquo;s invasive flames, but rather letting it seep through its carcass and abusing its power.

Alex Roe&rsquo;s haunting <i>Night of the Hunt</i> played on the background as the Puppet unleashed hell on us. It was generally regarded as one of the most chaotic fights of the whole event. The Puppet was relentless, pursuing its opponent (who was, as always during the boss fights, alone) until one of the fighters dropped dead. The pyromancies were thrown out very frequently, making aggression difficult and sometimes forcing us into panicked retreating. The fact that the Puppet was lagging during several points of the fight also did not help. This last part was later explained by the Puppeteer, who said: &ldquo;dragonslayer arena gets terribly laggy&rdquo;.

Very few succeeded in overcoming the mute knight. Yet, the Puppet&rsquo;s momentary endulgence in Great Old Sin&rsquo;s power was nearing its end. The Father dispels the idea that it is completely gone, though. #182 clearly states that from now on, the Puppet&rsquo;s soul will keep burning as if that of a true Lord of Cinder. The consumption of Yhorm had not only brought the mute knight over this threshold, but has also acquainted it with this accursed power enough to rule over it. Per the second line, it was not the flame dying down inside the Puppet, but the Puppet subduing the flame but its force of will.

It is also curious to note that despite this image of the Puppet&rsquo;s soul continuously becoming more and more like that of the Soul of Cinders/Great Old Sin, the third line of #182 states that the Puppet must not waste the flame recklessly. Does this mean that the flame of Sin could die down despite the fundamental alterations of the soul of the synthetic being?

With this question up for interpretation, the Lothric Castle had fallen into dead, sterile silence&mdash;only Puppet&rsquo;s weary steps echoing through its halls.
