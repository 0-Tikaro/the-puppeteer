An hour before 4pm GMT, the countdown began. Our excitement was no doubt rising for we were now keenly aware that yesterday&rsquo;s nine hour event was <b>just a third</b> of everything we would see.

As the countown reached zero, poem #155 announced the Puppet&rsquo;s awakening. Half a day of rest was, apparently, neither calm nor soothing to the mute knight. It went on &ldquo;unfeeling&rdquo; from its &ldquo;exhausting&rdquo; slumber, likely plagued by the resurfacing memories of puppets popping in and out of its mind. It may also be alluding to the Puppeteer&rsquo;s real-life state, as the event had (and would) undoubtedly take a toll on his immediate well-being.

Seeing how the Puppet was resting inside Wolnir&rsquo;s tomb, where yesterday it fought off the last waves of invaders, we were expecting it to proceed to Irithyll. The Puppeteer, however, chose a different route&mdash;to descend deeper down, into the Smouldering Lake.

The Puppet quickly traversed the long stretches of lukewarm water, and came down into the Demon Ruins. We were to search for it in this ancient maze riddled with half-dead hell-spawns. The Mad King&rsquo;s weapon art would sometimes be heard echoing somewhere near the Puppet, which only added to the atmosphere.

Unlike many areas before it, we faced the regular Puppet the first time we found it: using only its familiar Arstor&rsquo;s Spear and Drakeblood Greatsword. This was the state in which Fanboy, who was one of the first ones to get a fight, found the knight.

The apparent normality would soon be broken&mdash;#156 warned us. The Puppet was carefully constructed by the Father, its core made of the Humanity&rsquo;s cold flame and the Lord Soul &ldquo;entwined into the formless grey&rdquo; (#128). Yet inside that synthetic mixtures lay all the dead and broken puppets we faced in the span of the last five months. Lone Darkwraith&rsquo;s apparition emerged in the Cathedral of the Deep, Redflame Erik&rsquo;s mirage in Farron Keep, and what could be described as Soul of Cinders&rsquo; intrusive presence in the Catacombs. There was just one puppet previously seen in the Smouldering Lake&mdash;Wraithflame Erik.

A curious side-note: #156 sheds some more light on Wraithflame&rsquo;s state. Whatever was left of it, it was &ldquo;engulfed in wrath&rdquo;. We can theorize that it was just as enraged about its poor fate during its only event at the end of January (which, if you need a refresher, is described in chapter four: LINK LINK LINK #c180127 Ashes and Stitches LINK LINK LINK). The poem also pokes fun at the Father with the last line: &ldquo;Whose cruel hand sealed such a fate?&rdquo;. As we&rsquo;ve seen throughout the story, the Father is far from being a good man. He is not perfectly evil either, rather a neutral character steadily pursuing his goal, and capable of using even malicious methods to get closer to it. Even if it meant condemning two living beings to go out as an sorry amalgamation.

We didn&rsquo;t mention it yet, but the first Twtich blackground for this area was showing the Puppet fighting against the Carthus Sandworm, which appears to be a bit larger than the one we face in-game. This is, likely in the same vein as the Great Old Sin, the Puppeteer exaggerating the Puppet&rsquo;s foes for dramatic purposes.

Fitting with the Twitch background, the first recorded clip of the mute knight using Wraithflame Erik&rsquo;s weapons is set right where the sandworm dies. For the sake of storytelling we may imagine that the Puppet had just murdered the beast and descended into the ruins again, only to return back when pursuing Fanboy.

Surviving the encounter and venturing onwards, the Puppet was overcome by Wraithflame&rsquo;s apparition. It solidified itself in the knight&rsquo;s husk, as poem #157 once more reinforced our understanding of what Wraithflame was&mdash;an ireful conglomeration of two human souls forced to coexist in a single &ldquo;cage of flesh and skin&rdquo;.

It, though nothing but a vague recollection, could rage on as a brief spark. As the poem was sent, the summoning limits were turned off, and up to <b>five</b> eager invaders could challenge it at once. With more foes to face, the Puppet became more dangerous as well. Aggressive use of Power Within made its attacks devastating. This was especially true of its spear, which seemingly  benefited from a hidden Leo Ring effect, for its counter-damage was horrifying.

Despite having the tools to quickly dispatch single targets, the thing found it difficult to win against our constant stream of foes. Unsurprisingly, it fell back to more reactive strategies, showing some impressive evasive skills as its health reached the critical point.

(And of course, sometimes we, by a random stroke of bad luck, did not get into the Puppet&rsquo;s world&mdash;but in each-other&rsquo;s worlds instead. This was of course a time of reflection on camaraderie and friendship. But what was much more engaging&mdash;a time of beating each-other into bloody pulps.)

We were awfully deep in the ruins, down below the ruinous remains of Ash Lake. The Puppet, awoken from its half-day slumber and revitalized by constant combat, was ravenous. It must have greatly craved our souls, for in poem #158 the Puppet had temporarily threw down what control it had of its hunger.

Having gone through the deepest chambers of Demon Ruins and having consumed all that was still relatively alive within, the mute knight awaited us in place of the Old Demon King.

Recall what happened with the apparitions of the previous puppets the previous day. They shone the brightest during these boss encounters, when Puppet was slowly consuming them for good. This could also be the reason why we never saw the Puppet&rsquo;s main arsenal expanding, despite it having being overcome by three apparitions by now. After the boss encounter, the Pupept rids itself of the current apparition completely and ultimately, devouring whatever surfaced on its empty mind as we fought it in the area. And after that, nothing is left but more void to fill with souls, as the knight&rsquo;s hunger gnaws ever stronger.

Boss of the Smouldering Lake, fitting its high-tempo music score, came at us all guns blazing. Aggressive Power Within use in combination with a buffed Firelink Greatsword made for fast-paced combat where both sides could heavily punish any mistakes the opponent had made.

The fights were fast, and the opponents were plentiful. There was event a peculiar event happening at one point: not one, but <b>two</b> opponents were challenged by the Puppet at once, (Ensign and Fanboy). Nevertheless, as the Puppet was close to finishing its feast, the time came to move forth. #159 told of the final moments of Wraithflame&rsquo;s image: a feeble spark smothered by the unending flow of souls.

Here came another unique moment that would begin the Puppeteer&rsquo;s continuous breaking of character. Several of us asked for one more fight for an invade who couldn&rsquo;t get in on the action. With a short <i>"Very well."</i> they were brought in, and the boss-fight extended slightly.
