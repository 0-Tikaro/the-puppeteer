<h1 class="chapter-title" id="synopsis">Synopsis</h1>
<p>The Father is a man of wholly unimportant origin or story. In the slow, stagnating decay of Lothric, he knows the fate of the world just as well as everyone else. The Age of Fire, a clinging disease that plagues the realm from eons forgotten&mdash;it must be put to an end. Yet the Father is neither a warrior, scholar, nor cleric possessing the strength to do it alone. He, diligent befitting his great age, is a craftsman of a peculiar sort - crafting neither trinkets nor weapons, but living creatures.</p>
<p>In his pursuit to cleanse Lothric from the the Age's plague, he had gathered and prepared four puppets: White Vagrant - a feeble souls with a weighty blade; Lone Darkwraith - a derelict of a cult long perished; Redflame Erik - a not-quite-sane pyromaniac; and Oden the Armless - a towering cripple within whom slumber relics of a distant, brighter age. The four fought for the Father, the Father stitched wounds of the four.</p>
<p>Yet to achieve his goal, the four would not suffice. They were never intended to see the plan to fruition, either. No, their purpose was to awaken a much older, much more resilient creature, and in their inevitable demise&mdash;to provide the Father with precious resources for crafting a proper weapon. As more and more blood was shed, White Vagrant could not be repaired quite quickly enough: the Father favoring a cruel machination on Erik and the Wraith.</p>
<p>Vagrant perished&mdash;a weak fleeting spirit all that remained&mdash;and Darkwraith and Erik were stitched into one, still alive. Gruesome in execution yet careful in planning, the Father's plan was to let the two hollow away and leave behind purified scraps of a thing no longer abundant - of the Humanity. And as the hollow puppet grew, so grew the Humanity&mdash;at once ready to be harvested.</p>
<p>In great haste after the Vagrant's predictable death, the Father had imbued Oden the Armless with its remains. Restored fully in body and not quite so in soul, Oden had fallen into a deep, unending slumber, recalling eons he had forgotten in his endless wanders. Neither unkindled&mdash;nor human altogether&mdash;but a living remnant of the age of the Lord of Sunlight. Woken from his dreams to the realization of his body quickly failing, and sharing in Father's distaste of the poisonous Age, Oden offers what was left of his ancient, brilliant soul in hope that the Father will succeed in his venture.</p>
<p>Fleeting black flames of Humanity and radiant sparks of the oldest Soul&mdash;yet one more thing the Father had required for his delicate craft. A corpse strong enough to withstand an arduous journey that would end the Age of Fire. Such a corpse was known and already picked out by the craftsman. Deep in the ruins of the prehistoric sunlit prison&mdash;the Ringed City&mdash;lay peacefully a heartless warrior, first to be ensued with the task of protecting the city's slumbering princess. Felled by the the titan Lord of Thunder many eons ago, there he remained, struck by a cyclopean spear. By Father he was carefully awoken just as the first four puppets broke down. Enraged and of terrifying force it, too, had fallen, its useless soul torn away from the precious body without any concerns.</p>
<p>For many days had Father worked on his child: all muscles torn&mdash;remake, restitch; tissue and bone soon trapped in steel, head at last crowned in metal tough. And after many nights the arms had lifted, grasping at the night. Animated by the brightest sparks and blackest flames, it was not quite living yet certainly not dead. An unfeeling, mute, nameless puppet made and fit for the singular goal&mdash;to end the Age of Fire. It set out on its great journey, driven to kill the manifestation of this Age and rid the world of its corrupt influence...</p>
<p><br><br><br><br>...and once all things were said and done, it took a seat under dark bell. Its great deed is over, world breathes in shade. It, too, shall rest, enchain the hell&mdash;till even time itself will fade.</p>
