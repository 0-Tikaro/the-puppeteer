">Introduction</h2>
<p>The Puppeteer is a story of a man with great ambitions. A man steadfast, unrelenting in his harsh and meticulous methods. Opposed to the state of the world, he set it towards the path decidedly right by his own judgment.</p>
<p>What makes this story unique is the way it was told. What you are reading right now is not the original, but a written interpretation of the events that took place between December 2017 and May 2018. The original story was told through cryptic poems and in-game events held within a relatively small Dark Souls 3 community. I, Tikaro, was a part of this community as these events unfolded. Once we realized how peculiar and vast this story became, a decision was made that it would be worth sharing with the world after everything was said and done. And now, we are doing precisely that.</p>
<p>The site is divided into 5 main parts:</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="#synopsis">Synopsis</a> is a quick recap of the plot that will, hopefully, interest you enough to give the Chronolgy a read.</li>
    <li><a href="#chronology">Chronology</a> is the written version of the story. It is presented as a chronological log, describing both the real-life events we experienced and in-game lore the Puppeteer had built in the duration of the story. The writing is juiced up by in-game footage we have collected, showing many of our members interacting with the Puppeteer's "puppets" inside the game.</li>
    <li><a href="#characters">Characters</a> is an quick reference about all of the in-game character the Puppeteer had used throughout the story.</li>
    <li><a href="#poems">Poems</a> is a collection of all the poems the Puppeteer sent us. During the event, this was the only way he communicated with us.</li>
    <li><a href="#videos">Videos</a> is an archive containing all the footage we recorded during the 4 months when this story was being told. Same as with Poems, use this for a quick and handy reference.</li>
</ul>
