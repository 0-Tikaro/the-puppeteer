    <h1 class="chapter-title">I. &ldquo;Actors All Prepare&rdquo; </h1>
    <p class="chapter-desc">December, 2017
        <br>White Vagrant, Lone Darkwraith,
        <br>Redflame Erik, Oden the Armless</p>
    <p>The Puppeteer&rsquo;s game began in around the end of December of 2017. It is unknown how much pre-planning went into the event, but it&rsquo;s clear that the set of four puppets were prepared beforehand.</p>
    <p>The very first puppet to appear was the White Vagrant. On December 19th 2017, it appeared during a fight club hosted at Lothric Castle. Wielding a Murakumo and Pontiff Knight Curved Sword, the Vagrant stirred up the attention of fight club participants. At that point no one was even aware of the Puppeteer&rsquo;s existence. Nevertheless, the idea that this &ldquo;White Vagrant&rdquo; was a fellow Discord-member was passed around. It is unclear at which point of the fight club the puppet appeared and disappeared.</p>
    <p>The second puppet, Lone Darkwraith, was first seen on 21th. It appeared during a Dried Finger event hosted in Farron Keep, and agitating the host with careful Ringed Knight Spear plays. The Puppeteer remained silent during the whole event, so other participants were left to wonder on the identity of the player behind the Lone Darkwraith. The connection between White Vagrant and this puppet wasn&rsquo;t yet made.</p>
    <p>This puppet was seen the following day as well. As Raff, one of the discord members, brought a persistent gank-squad in the Great Belfry to everyone&rsquo;s attention. The gank was never found, but what was found was the puppet, dry fingered alone near the bonfire. The Darkwraith fought several people before, again, disappeared without a trace.</p>
    <p>The third puppet, Redflame Erik, appeared during another Dried Finger run on December 23rd. The DF run held place in Farron Keep and in the Catacombs. Host of the DF run, Nosferat, has seen Erik the previous day in the Cathedral of the Deep, so his reappearance was already somewhat suspicions. Moreover, the puppet&rsquo;s name was similar to another character - &ldquo;Blackflame Chloe&rdquo;. Add an extravagant playstyle into the mix, and the interest of the server members was captured. People began trying to figure out the Steam account of the person behind Redflame Erik, and eventually sending him a friend request with the intent of inviting them to the server. It is this point that we can count as the robust &lsquo;start&rsquo; of the Puppeteer&rsquo;s game, because at the end of this event Varyag (the man who sent the steam request and the player behind Blackflame Chloe) has received the poem <span class="tooltip">#1<span class="tooltiptext ref1"></span></span>, which was the culmination of Redflame Erik&rsquo;s appearance.</p>
    <p>The fourth and last puppet of the original roster, Oden the Armless, was seen on the following day. Nosferat was continuing his run and came up to Irithyll Dungeon. Oden was hunting him down throughout the whole area, eventually culminating in a fight on the roof of the church in the toxic swamp of the Profaned Capital. This fight would be much later be remembered in poem <span class="tooltip">#52<span class="tooltiptext ref52"></span></span>, during the time of Oden&rsquo;s recollections.</p>
    <p>The memorable part of Oden was the fact that he was quite literally missing one arm and one-handing all of his weapons. As later tested, the arm was removed via Cheat Engine by setting the proportions to a negative amount.</p>
    <p>Oden followed suite of Vagrant and Darkwraith, appearing and disappearing without notice and not sending any poems.</p>
    <p>On December 27th, White Vagrant appeared during Tikaro&rsquo;s Dried Finger run through the early game. This is also the first recorded appearance of the Puppeteer:</p>

    </div>

    <p>On January 8th 2018 Cephalon was streaming a DF run through the early areas of the game. Oden appeared and invaded him several times, sending poem <span class="tooltip">#2<span class="tooltiptext ref2"></span></span> afterwards. This poem was similar to <span class="tooltip">#1<span class="tooltiptext ref1"></span></span> in that it commented on the Cephalon&rsquo;s in-game character and given out a bit of lore. At this point an idea was echoed that both Oden and Erik are played by the same person - it would be a very unlikely coincidence that there were two separate unrelated players speaking in poems within the span of a couple of weeks.</p>
    <p><span class="tooltip">#2<span class="tooltiptext ref2"></span></span> is also the first poem that references the main character of the Puppeteer&rsquo;s game - the Father, who is the Puppeteer&rsquo;s personal in-universe analogue. He will be the main (and only) driving force of the story, setting in motion all the events. He never appeared as an in-game character, but from the gathered poems we can deduce that the Father is an old man (Oden speaks directly to the Father in <span class="tooltip">#108<span class="tooltiptext ref108"></span></span>) resolutely set on ending the Age of Fire (<span class="tooltip">#8<span class="tooltiptext ref8"></span></span>, <span class="tooltip">#53<span class="tooltiptext ref53"></span></span>). The game&rsquo;s story revolves around the Father&rsquo;s plan to kill the Soul of Cinders, which in the game is referred to as &ldquo;Great Old Sin&rdquo; or just &ldquo;Sin&rdquo;.</p>
    <p>On January 13th, Lone Darkwraith appeared again, disappearing without posting any poems.</p>
    <p>On January 16th, Redflame Erik made another appearance. Now, with all four puppets making an appearance several times, the stage was set for the Puppeteer&rsquo;s game to begin.</p>

        <br>Redflame Erik, Oden the Armless
        <br>Lone Darkwraith, White Vagrant</p>

    <p>Redflame Erik&rsquo;s sign was found it the Keep Perimeter bonfire by Vulc, who was doing a Dried Finger run. Erik kept trailing the run and switching between putting down a red sign and using his own Dried Finger to pull some active invaders towards him. He also was summoning people that were putting their mad signs down. Alex has recorded one of his short encounteres with Erik:</p>

        <div class="youtube" data-embed="7WWVafpD9Ro"><div class="play-button"></div></div>
    </div>

    <p>As some time passed, Alex received poem <span class="tooltip">#3<span class="tooltiptext ref3"></span></span>, stating that he will remain embered in Demon Ruins. Later, Puppeteer sent <span class="tooltip">#4<span class="tooltiptext ref4"></span></span> to Narcolept. This poem is more interesting than previous ones, as it references the origin of four original puppets. The four puppets seem to have originally been dead\hollowed out (as they &ldquo;slumbered in the dirt&rdquo;). The Father reanimated them, and during the fights with discord members, their past battle experience has also been restored (&ldquo;In battle you have made them thrive.&rdquo;). Narcolept has also recorded several fights with Erik:</p>

        <div class="youtube" data-embed="DyUabMJvMKA"><div class="play-button"></div></div>
    </div>

    <p>The Puppeteer sent alex poem <span class="tooltip">#5<span class="tooltiptext ref5"></span></span> in a little bit. This one said that Redflame Erik is satisfied, and that other puppets will take his place now. The second verse refers to each puppet of the original roster:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>"From faraway has traveled first" is the most cryptic one. It seems to be a foreshadowing of Heart of Spears, but he is also not from the original roster of four.</li>
        <li>"Second&rsquo;s but a phantom ripple" refers to White Vagrant, who appears to be a white spirit that has lost the connection to its original world, akin to Vagrants&rsquo; from DS1.</li>
        <li>"Third of Abyss" is Lone Darkwraith, as all Darkwraiths have a strong connection to the Abyss.</li>
        <li>"Next of a flaming thirst" - Redflame Erik.
        <li>"The last is but an armelss cripple" - the least cryptic one of references. This is Oden the Armless.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>Lastly, this poem also has a binary counter at the end. This is most likely to show in which order the following poems should be read.</p>
    <p>Oden the Armless began invading. During this segment the Steam name of the Puppeteer was figured out to be &ldquo;__t_he_pu_ppete_er&rdquo; (this is also the first time the name &ldquo;Puppeteer&rdquo; was used). As the event progressed, Lone Darkwraith and White Vagrant followed. Narcolept received poem <span class="tooltip">#6<span class="tooltiptext ref6"></span></span>, which talk about all of the puppets now having to be repaired, as they continuously &ldquo;fell from blades you wield&rdquo;. Poem <span class="tooltip">#7<span class="tooltiptext ref7"></span></span>, which would be sent a bit later, continues the ideas started in <span class="tooltip">#4<span class="tooltiptext ref4"></span></span> about the origin of the puppets.</p>
    <p>Narcolept also recorded a bunch of his fights with the Puppeteer during this event:</p>

    </div>

    <p>After killing White Vagrant all the way up in Irithyll, Paprika was sent poem <span class="tooltip">#8<span class="tooltiptext ref8"></span></span>. This is the first poem to talk about Father&rsquo;s main goal - to &ldquo;kill the Flame, the god of all&rdquo;. This is the Soul of Cinders, also know as &ldquo;Great Old Sin&rdquo;. The next time it will be brought up will be only in <span class="tooltip">#61<span class="tooltiptext ref61"></span></span>, more than a month in the future from this point.</p>
    <p>The event finished with Jean getting poem <span class="tooltip">#9<span class="tooltiptext ref9"></span></span>, which continued on <span class="tooltip">#6<span class="tooltiptext ref6"></span></span> in that the puppets have all sustained considerable damage, and must now be repaired by the Father. Starting from this point onwards, the Puppeteer&rsquo;s game will continue for almost four months, ending at May 14th.</p>

    <h1 class="chapter-title">III. Tear Them Down</h1>
    <p class="chapter-desc">January 21, 2018
        <br>Oden the Armless, Lone Darkwraith,
        <br>Redflame Erik</p>

    <p>Oden the Armless was the first one to appear this day. Tikaro was Dried Fingered and running through Crucifixion Woods when he appeared. Early on in the run, the Puppeteer sent poem <span class="tooltip">#10<span class="tooltiptext ref10"></span></span>, which fairly clearly stated that there were five puppets, not four as originally thought. The last, &ldquo;eastward&rdquo; one is the Heart of Spears, which at this time has not appeared yet.</p>
    <p>Narcolept, who will be one of the main people getting the Puppeteer on camera, recorded a couple of fights with Oden during this event:</p>

    <button class="collapsible"><i class="fas fa-film"></i>January 21, 2018 - Narcolept vs. Oden the Armless<i class="fas fa-angle-double-down" style="float: right;"></i></button>

        <div class="youtube" data-embed="BlRkAaVcg-M"><div class="play-button"></div></div>
    </div>

    <p>Just as during the previous event, Oden the Armless was eventually replaced by Lone Darkwraith, when Tikaro got to the Cathedral of the Deep. The puppet was invading and sometimes grabbing mad white signs in the Cleansing Chapel. After summoning Narcolept for a fight, the Puppeteer sent him poem <span class="tooltip">#11<span class="tooltiptext ref11"></span></span>. This one is likely a continuation of <span class="tooltip">#10<span class="tooltiptext ref10"></span></span> in foreshadowing the appearance of Heart of Spears.</p>

    </div>

    <p>Redflame Erik appeared in the Farron Keep, trailing the run as became common in the last month. Also, around this point it could be vaguely seen that the puppets had their own designated areas. Redflame Erik was tied to the Farron Keep, White Vagrant to Irithyll, Lone Darkwraith to Cathedral of the Deep, and Oden the Armless to Irithyll Dungeon. They didn&rsquo;t invade only these areas, but rather were tied to them thematically. This will be seen clearly during the final event, almost four months in the future.</p>

    </div>

    <p>At the end of the event, the Puppeteer joined the Discord server and sent poem <span class="tooltip">#12<span class="tooltiptext ref12"></span></span> himself. Joining, posting a new poem, and leaving would become the main way he would communicate with us for a while.</p>
    <p>Several days later, on January 25, the Puppeteer sent friend requests to the moderators of SL90 discord. Narcolept received poem <span class="tooltip">#13<span class="tooltiptext ref13"></span></span>, along with a string of broken AAAs. Alex got a a lot more AAAs that are qualified here as <span class="tooltip">#14<span class="tooltiptext ref14"></span></span>. Tikaro and Raff have sent friend requests to the Puppeteer. Both were accepted, and the two got <span class="tooltip">#15<span class="tooltiptext ref15"></span></span> and <span class="tooltip">#16<span class="tooltiptext ref16"></span></span> (haha), respectively. The only poem out of the four things sent expanded upon the then cryptic foreshadowing of what would happen to Redflame Erik and Lone Darkwraith during the next event.</p>

    <p class="chapter-desc">January 27, 2018
        <br>Wraithflame Erik, Broken Vagrant,
        <br>Heart of Spears</p>

    <p>This event would become an important one in the story, as this is the first time we see what the Father himself is capable of. The four puppets were sustaining heavy damage during the last month. They may have been repaired accordingly, or left to withstand without Father&rsquo;s interference. However, the time came for Lone Darkwraith and Redflame Erik to be used for their intended purpose.</p>
    <p>With poem <span class="tooltip">#17<span class="tooltiptext ref17"></span></span>, the Father&rsquo;s work was revealed and the event began. There, in Demon Ruins, Wraithflame Erik awaited. <span class="tooltip">#19<span class="tooltiptext ref19"></span></span> tells us more about the abhorrent abomination - it&rsquo;s two living beings stitched together! The Father&rsquo;s intent from the start was to stitch them together, for then he would be able to extract something very important from them. But there is still plenty of time until we come to that point. For now, the Father is satisfied, for success in merging two creatures together has relieved him of his doubts.</p>
    <p>Wraithflame Erik used things from arsenals of both of its component puppets, along with several new items such as Firelink Greatsword and Power Within. The thing was self-destructive, as the two beings it originated from both still existed in one new body (this will be expanded upon in <span class="tooltip">#39<span class="tooltiptext ref39"></span></span>, <span class="tooltip">#66<span class="tooltiptext ref66"></span></span>, and during the very end in <span class="tooltip">#150<span class="tooltiptext ref150"></span></span>, <span class="tooltip">#152<span class="tooltiptext ref152"></span></span>). Frequent use of Power Within made it a dangerous opponent capable of quickly dealing lots of damage, and reckless playstyle only amplified that.</p>
    <p>Poem <span class="tooltip">#20<span class="tooltiptext ref20"></span></span> continues on <span class="tooltip">#19<span class="tooltiptext ref19"></span></span> (as seen by the symbols at the end). It refers to the current state of Redflame Erik and Lone Darkwraith as &ldquo;at last ascended&rdquo;, with three other puppets still awaiting a similar fate. And the discord members would be actively taking part until the very end. As an unrelated detail, bold characters from <span class="tooltip">#19<span class="tooltiptext ref19"></span></span> and <span class="tooltip">#20<span class="tooltiptext ref20"></span></span> spell out &ldquo;balance&rdquo;, which may be a reference to Narcolept&rsquo;s main character, who is named &ldquo;The Balance&rdquo;.</p>
    <p>Wraithflame Erik is also the first puppet to use custom Cheat Engine gestures - it sat in the Gravetender&rsquo;s pose before engaging its opponents.</p>
    <p>This would be the only event when Wraithflame would appear. His short-lived segment ended with poem <span class="tooltip">#21<span class="tooltiptext ref21"></span></span>, which also simultaneously started the second segment. You can watch all the footage collected from this segment below:</p>

    <p>The second segment revolved around the White Vagrant, which was not seen during the previous event. Apparently, the Father was unable to repair it. Showing hesitance in letting the discord members find the &ldquo;Spears&rsquo; forgotten hearts&rdquo; just yet, he decides to force Vagrant to fight in Yorshka’s church. Yet something goes wrong, and <span class="tooltip">#22<span class="tooltiptext ref22"></span></span> redirects us to the Cleansing Chapel.</p>

    </div>

    <p>White Vagrant was severely damaged, and even had its name changed to &ldquo;Broken Vagrant&rdquo;. Fat-rolling and cripplede with misshapen limbs, Vagrant was actively suffering up to the moment it perished, as signified by <span class="tooltip">#23<span class="tooltiptext ref23"></span></span>, which is written from the puppet&rsquo;s perspective.</p>
    <p>We have ignored the AAAs which appeared from poem <span class="tooltip">#13<span class="tooltiptext ref13"></span></span> up to this point. As will be seen in the following two poems, they are the Vagrant&rsquo;s shrieks as it suffers from its continuously more ravaged state.</p>
    <p>Catpants tried to help the puppet by giving it Repair Powder, yet that did nothing. Eventually, the Vagrant started moving out of the Chapel towards the Cathedral, lying down in a jumbled pose in-between being invaded (presumably in the places where it was killed). Upon being found, it would struggle to get up with janky looking Cheat Engine animations.</p>
    <p>As it degraded ever further, poem <span class="tooltip">#24<span class="tooltiptext ref24"></span></span> told us that it had an unwavering resolve in the Father&rsquo;s overarching plan, and was willing to go through the painful death to advance it. After that, the puppet offered no more cohesive words or sentences, just shrieks that would all be combined together and saved as <span class="tooltip">#25<span class="tooltiptext ref25"></span></span>.</p>
    <p>As the Vagrant continued deep into the Cathedral, its condition worsened: the armor broke completely, limbs were misshapen even more, and it gained a constant poison debuff. Narcolept once found it atop the pile of misshapen bodies. It, nevertheless, made it all the way through the Cathedral, up to the Deacons of the Deep. At that point it lost the ability to even roll, and started fading away, first becoming a ghost-like thing that could not be locked on, then finally disappearing completely right before the boss room. Presumably, it was seeking the Doll to return to Irithyll, which is the area White Vagrant has been associated with.</p>

    </div>

    <p>The Father seemed to have been completely fine with such a conclusion, as he talks about the Vagrant in <span class="tooltip">#26<span class="tooltiptext ref26"></span></span> as a bunch of spare parts that can be used later. This poem also start the last segment of this relatively big event, and perhaps the most memorable one - the appearance of the Heart of Spears.</p>
    <p><span class="tooltip">#26<span class="tooltiptext ref26"></span></span> gave out only the cryptic name, so the invaders following the event were left to wonder where the next puppet might be found. The connection to Spears of the Church was made very quickly (and as will be seen much later, it was a fairly deep connection), yet it took considerable time to actually find the Heart of Spears. Poem <span class="tooltip">#27<span class="tooltiptext ref27"></span></span> gave us the description of the yet-to-be-found puppet, revealing it to be much older than any of the ones we were facing so far. It also made a connection to the &ldquo;Lord of Thunder&rdquo;, by whom it &ldquo;by spear was stricken cyclopean&rdquo;. Because of that it was thought that there could be some connection to the Nameless King. Therefore, Archdragon Peak was checked.</p>
    <p>As the searching drew out, poem <span class="tooltip">#28<span class="tooltiptext ref28"></span></span> gave more clarifications, mentioning &ldquo;pygmys&rsquo; dust&rdquo;. This narrowed the suspicions down to the Ringed City, which is the only place we ever find pygmies outside of Ludleth. Shared Grave was checked, the area before the Spear of the Church bossfight was checked - nothing.</p>
    <p>Eventually the idea to check the Purging Monument arose. Narcolept was the first lucky one to succesfully invade the Heart of Spears. He made his way all the way from the Shared Grave, and found the Heart by the Monument.</p>

    </div>

    <p>The striking unique feature of this puppet was, very obviously, the fact that it was impaled by Arstor&rsquo;s Spear through its heart. It also made use of unnaturally slim body proportions to hide surprisingly heavy armor with lots of poise. This allowed its Lucerne to trade with a lot of heavier weapons.</p>
    <p>Poems <span class="tooltip">#29<span class="tooltiptext ref29"></span></span> and <span class="tooltip">#30<span class="tooltiptext ref30"></span></span> were sent by the Puppeteer as more and more people fought the Heart of Spears. Expanding upon its lore, <span class="tooltip">#30<span class="tooltiptext ref30"></span></span> confirms that it was impaled specifically through the heart. Leaving the biology of how it is still alive aside (we are in Dark Souls after all), it is talked about as the most robust and powerful puppet that is currently known.</p>
    <p>Broken Vagrant has set a trend of breaking puppets down for parts, but poem <span class="tooltip">#31<span class="tooltiptext ref31"></span></span> (and later <span class="tooltip">#32<span class="tooltiptext ref32"></span></span>) laughingly shut the idea that we would be able to break Heart of Spears down. It also strengthened the connection between the Heart of Spears and the &ldquo;titan Lord&rdquo; it was enchained by. We eventually got to know who the &ldquo;titan Lord of Thunder&rdquo; was, but it will be left out for now for the sake of the narrative.</p>
    <p>Poem <span class="tooltip">#32<span class="tooltiptext ref32"></span></span> also gave some light on how the Father came upon the Heart of Spears. Apparently, he is old enough to have found it not long after the titan Lord put it to rest.</p>
    <p>As this huge event drew towards its conclusion, the Heart of Spears traversed the Ringed City all the way up to the Spear of the Church bossfight. There, Narcolept was beckoned with poem <span class="tooltip">#33<span class="tooltiptext ref33"></span></span>, as he did not invade after the first couple of times to let everyone else participate. What followed was an especially long fight between the two, &ldquo;fighting through all estus, divine blessings and 10 siegbraus&rdquo;. The recording of this fight can be seen below, as well as another fight with Ragg - another discord member.</p>

    <p>The event ended with poem <span class="tooltip">#34<span class="tooltiptext ref34"></span></span> shortly afterwards. It, again, gave a glimpse at the events that would go down in the near future: mainly at the fact that Wraithflame would be improved upon, and that there is another puppet that would need to be repaired. This would obviously be the White Vagrant, who was just broken down? No, no it wouldn&rsquo;t.</p>

    <h1 class="chapter-title">V. ...doth slumber deep</h1>
    <p class="chapter-desc">February 3, 2018
        <br>Slumbering Oden, Nameless Flame</p>

    <p>Prior to the day of the event, Raff privately received poem <span class="tooltip">#35<span class="tooltiptext ref35"></span></span> as a sort of &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry&rdquo; from the Puppeteer, because the timing of the events was unfavorable for Raff and he frequently could not join in.</p>
    <p>The Puppeteer was away for seven nights, as was promised by <span class="tooltip">#34<span class="tooltiptext ref34"></span></span>. Seven nights later, he returned.</p>
    <p>In similar vain to the last even, this one has been segmented into two distinct pieces - one per a puppet that got its &ldquo;maintenance&rdquo;.</p>
    <p>First segment started with poem <span class="tooltip">#36<span class="tooltiptext ref36"></span></span>, which Puppeteer has sent to Kallah in private. Its content was quite puzzling, as it did not hint at any location in particular. Rather, it gave a description of the puppet we would soon be facing: &ldquo;unwaking&rdquo;, &ldquo;elder vagrant in deep slumber&rdquo;.</p>
    <p>The search was of an exhaustive kind. Going off of the poem, we started invading through Archdragon Peak (&ldquo;ancient thunder&rdquo;) and Ashes of Ariandel (&ldquo;frigid star&rdquo;). No luck was had, so next associations were built. &ldquo;Elder vagrant&rdquo; gave an idea that it may be Irithyll - the area associated with White Vagrant. Untended Graves have also been suggested as a possible place of search. Neither of those ideas were correct, however White Vagrant indeed played a part in this segment.</p>
    <p>Eventually, the &ldquo;ancient thunder&rdquo; led to Gwyn&rsquo;s pantheon and, by consequence, Anor Londo. There at last Vulc has found Slumbering Oden at the highest peak of the cathedral. Oden has been refashioned, improved by the Father: his arm restored and wielding the giant Wolf Knight Greatshield. Astora Greatsword was replaced with Zweihander, the Partizan remained. Weapons were not scary, his buff was. Every weapon coated in special frozen weapon, proccing frostbite in two to three hits. Along with massive Zweihander damage, it was enough to take his opponents from fully healed to nigh death in a single combo. As a counter-balance, it appears that his Estus was weaker than usual.</p>
    <p>Poem <span class="tooltip">#37<span class="tooltiptext ref37"></span></span> was sent after we encountered him several times, shedding light on what became of the White Vagrant after previous event&rsquo;s ruthless massacre. In line with the suggestion <span class="tooltip">#26<span class="tooltiptext ref26"></span></span> gave, Father used Vagrant&rsquo;s &ldquo;fleeting soul&rdquo; to refine Oden the Armless and restore his arm. This meant that by now the original four puppets were completely gone: Redflame Erik and Lone Darkwraith were forcefully merged into Wraithflame Erik, and Oden consumed whatever was left of White Vagrant.</p>
    <p>Oden first appeared near the windows where Dragonslayer Greatbow was found in DS1. He then began slowly making his way out of the cathedral. At the base of the cathedral, Oden has shown the last trick he had up his sleeve. His Zweihander was capable of using not only Stomp, but also Neck Swipe and Spin Slash. He would use them passively before trying to hit the opponents, so we weren&rsquo;t caught completely by surprise.</p>

    <p>We received <span class="tooltip">#38<span class="tooltiptext ref38"></span></span> after some time has passed. Continuing on the lore of Oden, Father ponders on the consequences of puppet&rsquo;s maintenance. As would become apparent far in the future, the consequences were non-insignificant and played an important role to Father&rsquo;s overarching plan.</p>
    <p>A theory was proposed that White Vagrant&rsquo;s soul was overtaking Oden&rsquo;s mind.</p>
    <p>Poem <span class="tooltip">#39<span class="tooltiptext ref39"></span></span> strayed away from the string of lore we have been getting. It confirmed the suspicions about Wraithflame Erik - the two living beings it was made out of were enraged by their fate (yet could not overpower the Father). In contrast to that, Oden was saddened, perhaps by the brutal death of the Vagrant, and retreated to reminiscence.</p>
    <p>What would he reminisce about? About things of great age, things that could well be considered legends by now. As this poem was sent, Oden began behaving strangely. He would now be found sleepwalking, wandering aimlessly and bumping into walls. During these times, we would have to shake him away in one way or another.</p>

    <p>Despite being in such a comatosed state, Oden made steady progress out of the cathedral and, eventually, into the Darkmoon Tomb. Upon getting to the altar, he pulled out a chime and rung it three times. This would become a custom to do for the time he was inside the tomb.</p>

    <button class="collapsible"><i class="fas fa-film"></i>February 3, 2018 - Ragg vs. Slumbering Oden<i class="fas fa-angle-double-down" style="float: right;"></i></button>

    </div>

    <p>During the puppet&rsquo;s time inside the tomb, the Puppeteer sent us <span class="tooltip">#40<span class="tooltiptext ref40"></span></span>. This poem was initially not understood at all, since it seemingly does not relate to anything. After a bit of brainstorming, however, we came to the conclusion that it is the Father speaking about Wraithflame Erik. The puppet was enraged and self-destructing, along with using a lot of fire-based equipment. This lines up with the &ldquo;unruly spark&rdquo;. Moreover, it was the first puppet to be stitched from other ones, which would make it the highest grade puppet in Father&rsquo;s arsenal.</p>
    <p>As Oden was becoming ever more weary, <span class="tooltip">#41<span class="tooltiptext ref41"></span></span> signified the point of no return for him. If previously Slumbering Oden could be woken up, this time he has &ldquo;gone too far in endless sleep&rdquo;. Jean was the last to witness him, as he was sleeping in front of the tomb, at the place where Anri can be found. Oden no longer took any damage, be it from a physical attack or status effects like toxin. Replicating the peculiar ringing of the chime also did nothing, even with precisely the same chime (the Crystal Chime).</p>
    <p>After a fair bit of experimentation, poem <span class="tooltip">#42<span class="tooltiptext ref42"></span></span> was directed at Jean&rsquo;s fruitless attempts at waking the puppet up. The interesting part is the last line, separated from the rest. There is no consensus on what it was meant to signify. It could be a precursor to Oden&rsquo;s impending transformation. It could also be him describing the frost affinity he obtained after merging with White Vagrant. It was also thought that this could be a hit as to where to search for the next puppet (which turned out to not be the case).</p>
    <p>Mere minutes after <span class="tooltip">#42<span class="tooltiptext ref42"></span></span> was sent, <span class="tooltip">#43<span class="tooltiptext ref43"></span></span> followed. A lot less cryptic in nature, it signaled the hour break before the second segment.</p>
    <p>As expected, an hour later <span class="tooltip">#43<span class="tooltiptext ref43"></span></span> resumed the action. As Oden was sent off onto a path of no return, there was yet another puppet that Father had promised would undergo &ldquo;maintenance&rdquo;.</p>
    <p>This would be, quite unsurprisingly, Wraithflame Erik, whose &ldquo;flaws were noted&rdquo; a week ago (<span class="tooltip">#34<span class="tooltiptext ref34"></span></span>). Back then, it was desperately longing to separate itself back into the two beings it originally was. Its attempts were pointless, and Father was able to crush their opposition completely, by &ldquo;purging&rdquo; them to the dark. In there, Wraithflame Erik has shed everything but its very core. Emerged as a single entity, Nameless Flame stood before us.</p>
    <p>Found in the Untended Graves, this distilled version of Wraithflame would be the first puppet that would unanimously be considered a miniboss. Its arsenal was made up of Onyx Blade, Ringed Knight Straight Sword and Spear. The latter two were also permanently buffed with blackflame. The most interesting part of the puppet were, however, its custom spells. It had three: first a very quick Black Fire Orb, a smaller weak Black Orb that could not be seen until it hit something, and a big explosive ground slam.</p>

    <p>Soon after Nameless Flame&rsquo;s first appearance, poem <span class="tooltip">#45<span class="tooltiptext ref45"></span></span> was sent. Despite all the efforts put in by Redflame and Darkwraith to separate themselves and resist the Father&rsquo;s hand, the latter was undoubtedly stronger. Thus both of their lives ended, leaving behind only a single black Flame that lacked not just a personality, but even a name. The meaning of the diamond symbol after the poem is unknown.</p>
    <p>Much like <span class="tooltip">#40<span class="tooltiptext ref40"></span></span>, in poem <span class="tooltip">#46<span class="tooltiptext ref46"></span></span> the Father is absorbed in thought. It is here that we glimpse his plan once more. Should one bring the end to the Age of Light, what follows? Will it be better, or worse? And what happens right between the Ages? Perhaps this distilled thing, though lacking in any personality, knows the answers.</p>

    <p>Shortly after fighting the puppet, Noxuary recieved <span class="tooltip">#47<span class="tooltiptext ref47"></span></span>. The three binary digits correlate to decimal &ldquo;5 15 2&rdquo;. Its intended meaning is unknown, but the Puppeteer has sent out more of them in the future.</p>
    <p>Narcolept was having trouble invading at the time, so he messages the Puppeteer in private, and they had a pleasant back-and-forth conversation without a single word:</p>

        <br>Nameless Flame</p>

    <p>Several days later, a curiously short event took place. Not only that, but there was not a single poem sent in its duration.</p>
    <p>The Puppeteer sent a simple &ldquo;Cleansing Chapel 0000&rdquo; message at the start of the event. It was fairly obvious that this was a location and a password, so Ragg tried to put a Red Sign down at the Chapel. This was the correct course of action, and he was greeted by Nameless Flame.</p>

    <p>There were several noteworthy changes in the puppet. First of all, it now obtained a Humanity Head akin to Harald Legion knights from the Dreg Heap. Moreover, its spells were changes slightly. The weak invisible black orb was replaced with a slightly modified Black Serpent, and all of his spells gained an Unfaltering prayer variant.</p>
    <p>After several people got to fight the puppet, it disappeared without the Puppeteer announcing it in any way. The rest of the collected clips can be seen below:</p>

    <h1 class="chapter-title">VII. Titan&rsquo;s Dream</h1>
    <p class="chapter-desc">February 9–15, 2018</p>

    <p>After the momentary silent appearance of the Nameless Flame, what followed was a string of exposition poems unrelated to in-game events. </p>
    <p>On February 9, poem <span class="tooltip">#49<span class="tooltiptext ref49"></span></span> was left in the discord server. Unknowing of the way the Puppeteer had planned this section of the story, we set out on an fruitless search for a puppet. Archdragon Peak was checked (&ldquo;The bell&rdquo;). &ldquo;Frigid whisper&rdquo; combined with &ldquo;the bell&rdquo; gave an idea to look in the Snowy Mountain Pass, because there was a broken bell in there. Irithyll was suggested as a possibility, because the Small Doll&rsquo;s item description says that it whispers. Even Eleanora (so we checked the Profaned Capital) was suggested as a connection, for its weapon art both rung like a bell and gave a bleed buff. Alas, no puppet was to be found anywhere.</p>
    <p>Poem <span class="tooltip">#49<span class="tooltiptext ref49"></span></span> however, was not tied to an in-game event. Rather, it told of Oden&rsquo;s thoughts as he was in his &ldquo;endless&rdquo; slumber (<span class="tooltip">#41<span class="tooltiptext ref41"></span></span>). Most of the poems speak from Father&rsquo;s perspective, yet some come directly from his puppets. We&rsquo;ve already seen Broken Vagrant speak directly to us. But Oden&rsquo;s speech will be the only one to gain a unique typographic quality: from here onwards all of his poems will be italicized.</p>
    <p>As we will learn throughout this week, this was just the beginning of Oden&rsquo;s long dream. The remains of White Vagrant still have influence on Oden&rsquo;s dream, likely because its soul did not yet merge into Oden completely. </p>
    <p>The interesting part of the poem is the third line. What are the golden rays? Why would they be cursed and, moreover, has Oden cursed them in the past? Associations to the Ringed City were built fairly quickly, as it&rsquo;s the only truly &ldquo;golden&rdquo; area we get to visit in the game, yet that line of thought led us nowhere for now.</p>
    <p>The fourth line is ever more cryptic. It appears as if Oden suddenly hears the ringing of the bell. The &ldquo;bleeding&rdquo; part was for a long time thought in a literal sense (and thus Eleanora kept reappearing in our discussions), but in the end it seems to be just a figure of speech for &ldquo;ringing&rdquo;. The question still stands - which bell did Oden hear? Was it the Bell of Awakening that brought the Unkindeled from their graves? That line of reasoning looks promising, but as we will later learn, Oden is not an Unkindeled, far from it. In the end, we never figured out the precise meaning of the bell.</p>
    <p>About an hour after poem <span class="tooltip">#49<span class="tooltiptext ref49"></span></span> was sent, <span class="tooltip">#50<span class="tooltiptext ref50"></span></span> followed. Take attention to how only one these lines is italicized. Father speaks of Oden in greater detail, confirming that he can no longer be found in a physical realm, as he is wandering deep inside his dream. It is unknown if this dream is meant to be something similar to Bloodborne&rsquo;s dreams, or if it&rsquo;s a more realistic dream where Oden is just going his memories separated by unimportant haze.</p>
    <p>Nothing else was sent on February 9, and the general consensus became that these poems symbolized Oden going through a &ldquo;rebirth&rdquo; of sorts. As we would come to learn, this was correct.</p>
    <p>We took a last stab at Untended Graves to see if maybe, just maybe, we have missed a puppet. That was not the case, and we were left empty-handed.</p>
    <p>February 10 gifted us with more lore, still being related to Oden&rsquo;s dream. Just as with previous poems, these were not tied to an in-game event.</p>
    <p>Seemingly being in control of his memories, in <span class="tooltip">#51<span class="tooltiptext ref51"></span></span> Oden remembers a &ldquo;great, blood-thirsty mess&rdquo; he was involved in at some point in the past. It is important to note that we have one hint at the time of this memory: Oden was a &ldquo;cripple&rdquo;, meaning he was missing his arm. This means that it couldn&rsquo;t be during Slumbering Oden&rsquo;s events.</p>
    <p><span class="tooltip">#52<span class="tooltiptext ref52"></span></span> was sent shortly afterwards, and it not only shed more light on Oden&rsquo;s story, but also placed <span class="tooltip">#51<span class="tooltiptext ref51"></span></span> fairly firmly inside the timeline. As would become apparent, each subsequent memory of Oden would be placed further in the past than all the previous ones. So <span class="tooltip">#51<span class="tooltiptext ref51"></span></span> had to be the most recent recollection.</p>
    <p><span class="tooltip">#52<span class="tooltiptext ref52"></span></span> talks about an event we can concretely place on the timeline. Oden recalls the time he fought Nosferat in the Profaned Capital, during one of his first appearances. This, in turn, meant that <span class="tooltip">#51<span class="tooltiptext ref51"></span></span> was set after Oden first appeared and before he became the Slumbering Oden. From that, we could deduce that it spoke about one of the Dried Finger runs Oden had invaded.</p>
    <p>On the following day, February 11, poem <span class="tooltip">#53<span class="tooltiptext ref53"></span></span> continued on the puppet&rsquo;s slumber. This one had sparked more discussions, and two general theories arose. First one was that Oden was found by the Father, second that he was found by Pontiff Sulyvahn. You can read more about both of them in the Lore section, here we will say that we have decided that the first theory was the correct one. Going on from that, in <span class="tooltip">#53<span class="tooltiptext ref53"></span></span> Oden recollects one of his darkest moments in life - the time just before he became Father&rsquo;s puppet. We also learn that Father was not a person of impressive visual qualities, as he &ldquo;seemed just a man&rdquo;. However, Oden, who was undoubtebly a wise being at least due to his age, saw through the man and understood his &ldquo;profaned ambition&rdquo;. This almost certainly refers to the Father&rsquo;s plan to end the Age of Fire.</p>
    <p>Just a couple of minutes after this poem was sent, Tikaro received <span class="tooltip">#54<span class="tooltiptext ref54"></span></span>. Unrelated to recent lore poems, it was the Puppeteer commenting on the google doc Tikaro was maintaining at the time (and which would become the basis for this write-up). The timing of a lot of recent events has also been inconvenient for Tik, so in that regard this poem was also similar to <span class="tooltip">#35<span class="tooltiptext ref35"></span></span>.</p>
    <p>On February 12, poem <span class="tooltip">#55<span class="tooltiptext ref55"></span></span> resumed Oden&rsquo;s dreaming. It was the first one to give us a glimpse at the moments in time predating the Father, and inching us towards the reality of who Oden was. Even before Father had found him and gave him the &ldquo;last purpose&rdquo;, he was already very old and very much missing an arm.</p>
    <p>The glimpse into the past is the last line: &ldquo;for my clear eye was not forgiven...&rdquo;. We spoke a fair bit about what this could signify, and ultimately came to the conclusion that will be completely clear later:</p>
    <p>just as the Father, Oden was against the synthetic prolongation of the Age of Fire that gods were protecting. And for this &ldquo;clear eye&rdquo;, he was punished. Was he a Chosen Undead long ago, perhaps even before the time when Dark Souls 1 takes place, and failed in his try to overtake the remaining gods? We didn&rsquo;t have enough information yet to make such a conclusion. We still had a fairly good hunch that he was old, a lot older than other puppets (aside perhaps for the Heart of Spears?).</p>
    <p>The next day confirmed such suspicions, in the enraged shouts of <span class="tooltip">#56<span class="tooltiptext ref56"></span></span>. It becomes apparent that Oden is not just dissatisfied with the state of the world, but was also openly against the path that Gwyn chose. There is an important details, however. Oden refers to Gwyn as the &ldquo;Lord of Sunlight&rdquo;. This is not the only title that Gwyn had. During the Dark Souls 1 he would become known as the &ldquo;Lord of Cinders&rdquo;, and during Dark Souls 3 he would become known as the &ldquo;First Lord&rdquo;. &ldquo;Lord of Sunlight&rdquo; was his first title, and for Oden to know it meant that he was alive and present maybe even before the events of the first game.</p>
    <p>After a bit of time, the Puppeteer announced the next in-game event by sending poem <span class="tooltip">#57<span class="tooltiptext ref57"></span></span> along with &ldquo;Great Belfry 0001&rdquo;. The poem was referring to the Nameless Flame, who became the main puppet for the events after its appearance. In hindsight, <span class="tooltip">#57<span class="tooltiptext ref57"></span></span> can be interpreted as the Flame growing and maturing, as it fought more and more people.</p>
    <p>Same as the time we saw the Nameless Flame in the Cleansing Chapel, he was waiting for the red signs. And same as the last time, there were no poems sent during the whole event. The stage was completely occupied by Oden&rsquo;s dream, and Nameless Flame disappeared after giving each one of us a couple of fights.</p>

    <p>We have come to the very end of Oden&rsquo;s dreams. Just one more day remained. On February 15, <span class="tooltip">#58<span class="tooltiptext ref58"></span></span> was sent, each line sent to a different discord channel. &ldquo;Gaol&rdquo; being another word for &ldquo;jail&rdquo;, this one spoke about the ancient times of the construction of the Ringed City. Some time later in the story, this poem also gave us an idea that Heart of Spears and Oden could have met before, as the general consensus became that Heart of Spears is the very first Spear of the Church. Why would he confront Oden for &ldquo;his dark mind&rdquo;? Perhaps Oden&rsquo;s dissatisfaction with the Age of Fire was so strong, he intended to wake\kill princess Filianore and undo the gods&rsquo; grand illusion.</p>
    <p>As a cute gesture, Raff has decided to write his own poem and send it to the Puppeteer:</p>
    <p style="text-align:center;">A hazardous path you’ve walked, my friend
        <br>Yet still, we cannot see the end
        <br>Through stitching sown sinew you’ve shown us a fight
        <br>But when will this challenge pass into the night?</p>
    <p>The Puppeteer was quick to respond with <span class="tooltip">#59<span class="tooltiptext ref59"></span></span>, which, again, was not a part of Oden&rsquo;s dream. He did, curiously, refer to himself as &ldquo;the end&rdquo; of the story (but no, we did not face &ldquo;The Puppeteer&rdquo; as the final boss).</p>
    <p>The very last poem of Oden&rsquo;s dream was sent on the same day and, fittingly, ended this segment of the story on a nice clean <span class="tooltip">#60<span class="tooltiptext ref60"></span></span>. An immediate continuation of <span class="tooltip">#59<span class="tooltiptext ref59"></span></span>, it speaks more about the confrontation between Oden and the &ldquo;slave firstborn of sunlit prison&rdquo;, which also became known as &ldquo;keeper first of secret last&rdquo;. An idea that Oden may have been the &ldquo;titan Lord of Thunder&rdquo; arose, since we know from <span class="tooltip">#27<span class="tooltiptext ref27"></span></span>, <span class="tooltip">#31<span class="tooltiptext ref31"></span></span>, and <span class="tooltip">#33<span class="tooltiptext ref33"></span></span> that Heart of Spears was put to rest by the aforementioned lord. The idea sounded good, but we were not sure it was the case just yet.</p>
    <p>And so, a fairly big chunk of exposition has ended. It was an interesting change of pace from the fairly frequent long in-game events, but it would also become boring if there were many more of these. Fortunately, this was not the case.</p>

    REREAD THIS OLD LORE SECTION WHEN POLISHING THIS CHAPTER:
    <h3>Cripple in Wonderlands - Slumber set analysis</h3>
    <p>After the event of 3 Feb 2018, Oden fell into deep, endless sleep (<span class="tooltip">#41<span class="tooltiptext ref41"></span></span>). The “Slumber Set” refers to the set of poems sent between 9 Feb and 15 Feb, describing Oden’s fragmented recollection of his own past.</p>
    <p>The first recollection we get to see starts with Oden, alone, wandering in haze. It could be interpreted as him observing the feverish dream-like state he is in.</p>
    <p>Oden is led to an unknown to him place by a frigid whisper. This was speculated to be the influence of Pontiff’s Eyes or the Small Doll, which leads you to Irithyll. It would make sense, as Oden the Armless became Slumbering Oden after being stitched together with the remnants of White Vagrant, who had strong connections to Irithyll.</p>
    <p>He questions whether he’s led to once more curse the golden rays. In light of more recent poems of Oden, Lord of Hail, it could be interpreted as cursing the old gods of Lordran and, more specifically, Gwyn. <span class="tooltip">#56<span class="tooltiptext ref56"></span></span> shows Oden literally cursing the Lord of Sunlight and his whole lineage.</p>
    <p>After a pause, Oden hears the bell bleed. This was speculated to be in some relation to Eleanora, as its Weapon Art produces a bell-ringing sound and gives the weapon a bleed buff. However, as of 31 Mar 2018, Eleanora has not been seen used by Lord of Hail nor of having any connections to him. More likely is that this refers to the bell at Archdragon Peak, where Lord of Hail was fought.</p>
    <p><span class="tooltip">#50<span class="tooltiptext ref50"></span></span> is not italicized, which suggests that this is not Oden’s PoV, but Father’s. He is talking about the giant, slumbering in the womb. To body of the giant was stitched and no longer has any place. The giant in question would be Oden (who out of all of the puppets had by far the largest frame). Slumbering in the womb suggests a rebirth of some sort. This symbolism was made clearer by the appearance of Lord of Hail, which is strongly suggested to be Oden being ’reborn’/awoken from his slumber.</p>
    <p>His mind, unfolding, shall soon bloom in hindsight is a clear precursor to Oden remembering more and more of his past in the following poems, ultimately returning to the world not as Slumbering Oden, but as Lord of Hail. It’s also worth noting that this is the only italicized line of the poem.</p>
    <p>Fanboy: So I was thinking about the lines &ldquo;his mind, unfolding, will soon bloom&rdquo; and &ldquo;for my clear eye was not forgiven&rdquo;. Assuming Oden is somehow linked to Pontiff, could this mean that he was at some point given one of the eyes that drive their holders mad (mind unfolding) but will be able to overcome its effects (mind will soon bloom). This was my initial idea, but then I checked some of the videos and he doesn&rsquo;t seem to fight in a savage manner, like the outrider knights.</p>
    <p>While he doth wander far from space seems to just be referring to the fact that Oden’s recollecting of the past is happening in the realm of dreams, not in the real physical world. Other interpretations include a sort of ‘mental ascension’</p>
    <p>Oden, the fearless cripple, was involved in a large-scale unorganized, chaotic battle (oh what a great, blood-thirsty mess…). All of his opponents withstood his offense, and raised their blades in retaliation.</p>
    <p>The next poem gives an idea that this large-scale brawl may have been during some event with participants from the Discord.</p>
    <p><span class="tooltip">#52<span class="tooltiptext ref52"></span></span> is talking about one of the very first appearances of Oden the Armless. Oden encountered and fought Seeker Valicarn (Nosferat’s character) on the rooftops in the Profaned Capital. Oden doesn’t seem too certain about him being a Cathedral Knight, perhaps due to his memory being hazy.</p>
    <p>At this point in time, the stage was set. It is unclear what this might be referring to.</p>
    <p>This has happened before the brawl described in <span class="tooltip">#51<span class="tooltiptext ref51"></span></span>, so it’s likely that these poems are describing the events in a reverse order, from most recent to most distant.</p>
    <p>Even before his appearance, Oden was hollowed, which could be interpreted as him being literally a hollow, or perhaps just extremely bored/having no purpose. At this dark time, a man found Oden. This man didn’t seem to be extraordinary, yet had a certain profaned ambition stirring up within him.</p>
    <p>One interpretation is that the man in question is Pontiff Sulyvahn, whose story also began in dark in the Painted World of Ariandel. As per Fanboy’s addition, the Profaned Greatsword description reads:
        <br>"Long ago, when Sulyvahn was yet a young sorcerer, he discovered the Profaned Capital and an unfading flame below a distant tundra of Irithyll, and a burning ambition took root within him."
        <br>
        <br>The choice of words profaned ambition seems very deliberate, and lines up very well with this description.
    </p>
    <p>Another possibility is that the man is the Father, and this is the point when he found Oden and made him his puppet. The later poems did reveal that Father has some plan in mind, which he was working towards (perhaps since the very beginning of the overarching event). <span class="tooltip">#88<span class="tooltiptext ref88"></span></span> suggests that this might even be something on the scale of the `end of the world` (to think that I&rsquo;m its epilogue to fill...).</p>
    <p>Oden recalls the darker days, perhaps even before the encounter with the man from the previous poem. Whether it was Pontiff or Father, second line seems to suggest that the man gave Oden his last purpose. NEED TO LOOK AT LORD’S POEMS FOR THIS.</p>
    <p>At this point in time, Oden was already old and crippled, which might refer to him already missing his arm.</p>
    <p> Terrid: A pontiff knight deserter who fights the effects of the eye rings? I dig it. Perhaps, he is armless because of something similar to Princess Mononoke where his arm is corrupted? Or he was undergoing the beastly transformation into what Vordt and Dancer are and removed his arm to stop said transformation</p>
    <p>The last line can be interpreted in several ways:
        <br>-          “I was doomed to fall and not forgiven because of my clear eye”. In this interpretation, Oden was doomed to fall, which was unrelated to his clear eye.
        <br>-          “I was doomed to fall because my clear eye wasn’t forgiven”. In this one, Oden was doomed specifically because his eye was unforgiven.
        <br>Either way you look at it, his clear eye was not forgiven. A clear eye might refer literally to one of his eyes having some supernatural power, but it’s more likely that it’s a metaphor for Oden seeing/understanding something he shouldn’t have.</p>
    <p>If we follow the idea of Oden being related to Pontiff and his knights, it could also be interpreted as him getting rid of one of Pontiff’s eyes, while the other one was already taking its toll. The Left eye also provides regen ability, which can be linked to Priscilla’s Lifehunt Scythe, which was a grave sin against the Gods and nature itself.
        <br>"Bewitched ring that Pontiff Sulyvahn bestowed upon his knights.
        <br>Knights who peer into the black orb are lured into battles of death, transformed into frenzied beasts. No wonder the Pontiff only provides these rings to those dispatched to foreign lands." (Description of Pontiff’s Eye Rings)
        <br>
        <br>"Scythe born from the soul of Priscilla, the stark white crossbreed trapped inside the painted world of Ariamis.
        <br>Even the Gods feared Priscilla&rsquo;s lifehunt ability, and in the hands of a mortal, its power will turn upon its wielder."
        <br>(Description of Lifehunt Scythe from DS1)
        <br>
        <br>"Aldrich dreamt as he slowly devoured the God of the Darkmoon. In this dream, he perceived the form of a young, pale girl in hiding."
        <br>(Description of Lifehunt Scythe from DS3)
    <p> The Priscilla was locked away in the Painted World of Ariamis, which became the base for the Painted World of Ariandel, which is where Pontiff originated from. This provides at least a vague connection between the Pontiff and Lifehunt Scythe.</p>
    <p>Given all of this, it is possible that Oden sought to obtain some sort of lifehunt/regen ability, perhaps to return his former youth and power (he is often referred to as old and crippled). This theory still holds up after receiving the Lord of Hail’s set of poems. If Oden was a lesser Lord from the times of Lordran, after living for centuries or even millennia past its downfall, he could have been seeking to return to his former level of power before going hollow and losing his purpose. On the other hand, <span class="tooltip">#84<span class="tooltiptext ref84"></span></span> calls the Lord of Hail’s strong appearance as a facade, “no great flame, but dying candle,” suggesting only a minor or superficial return of power.</p>
    <p>A fairly straight-forward curse towards Gwyn (the only character to ever be referred in the game as Lord of Sunlight) and his whole lineage. Here, and in the following poems of Oden (including the Lord of Hail’s set) we get a pretty clear image that Oden is openly against Gwyn and his doings.</p>
    <p>Feeble coward! Servant of thine fear! may refer to the fact that Gwyn linked the First Flame in fear of losing power, as the Age of Dark was coming closer and Age of Light was at its end. Did Oden see an alternative way to extend the Age of Light, or was he perhaps against the rule of Gods altogether?</p>
    <p>Another interesting detail is that Oden uses “Lord of Sunlight” to refer to Gwyn, instead of the “First Lord”. The former title was held by Gwyn only before linking the First Flame (afterwards he became known as Lord of Cinders), even before the events of DS1. This gives points to the idea that Oden has been around since the times of Lordran, which lines up with the idea of him being a surviving God.</p>
    <p>(Gaol is synonymous for “jail”)</p>
    <p>If we continue Ensign’s theory, this poem might be referring to Oden’s encounter with Heart of Spears: the sunlit prison is the Ringed City and Filianore, slave firstborn could be referring to the very first Spear of the Church, tasked to forever defend the princess from anyone who tries to wake her up.</p>
    <p>Dark mind also sounds fitting for Oden, as this is how his intentions would be seen by Gods whom he had opposed. It could even refer specifically to him desiring to wake/kill Filianore.</p>
    <p>The meaning of the last line is unclear, even if we assume the poem is about Heart of Spears from Oden’s point of view. What could Heart of Spears expect to find when encountering Oden? Him murdering Filinaore? Or his open opposition of the Gods?</p>
    <p>The final poem in the Slumber set, as indicated by the absence of trailing ellipses. This can be interpreted in light of the event with the death of Heart of Spears as the culmination of the encounter between Oden and the Heart, which was started in poem <span class="tooltip">#58<span class="tooltiptext ref58"></span></span>.</p>
    <p>Oden may have known the real name of Heart of Spears, as the one we know is definitely a title or a description, not a name. Nevertheless, he knows the name no more, suggesting that he either forgot it after living countless lifetimes, or specifically purged it from his memory for some reason.</p>
    <p>“Keeper first of secret last” sounds like a straightforward description of Heart of Spears, if we assume it’s the first Spear of the Church.</p>
    <p>We already have suspicions that Oden fought with Heart of Spears at some point, so HoS being the &ldquo;keeper&rdquo; could fit into our theories so far. Other thoughts that fit this interpretation are:
        <br>- The Spears of the Church guard Filianore&rsquo;s illusion--which is, in a way, &ldquo;keeping&rdquo; a secret.
        <br>- In a metaphorical sense, one keeps secrets in one&rsquo;s heart.
        <br>- We know from poem <span class="tooltip">#27<span class="tooltiptext ref27"></span></span> that HoS has been &ldquo;slumbering&rdquo; for a long time.
    </p>
    <p>The latter half of the poem is more convoluted. Oden and Heart of Spears fought for six nights, yet six nights afore, Heart of Spears fell in deep slumber, aghast. “Afore” is an archaic synonym for “before”, so at face value it means that Heart of Spears fought Oden while in a dreaming state. Another note is that he fell in said dream aghast, i.e. having been stricken with sudden, unexpected fear. Poem <span class="tooltip">#95<span class="tooltiptext ref95"></span></span> extends this train of thought, saying that Heart of Spears to dark was plunged in days forgone.</p>
    <p>This concludes the “Slumber set” of poems, which gave us a lot of insight into who Oden is and was.</p>

    <h1 class="chapter-title">VIII. Spear&rsquo;s Wake</h1>
    <p class="chapter-desc">February 25, 2018
        <br>Heart of Spears</p>

    <p>Heart of Spears continued Nameless Flame&rsquo;s trend of hosting events in silence. This time, Jean and Narcolept got peculiar personal messages from the Puppeteer: &ldquo;0010 1.&rdquo; and &ldquo;0010 2.&rdquo; respectively. In addition to the text, both were sent the following screenshot, showing Heart of Spears sitting on top of a flower bed in the Ringed City:</p>

    <img src="assets/images/180225_heart_of_spears.jpg" data-action="zoom"/>

    <p>By now we have figured out that if there was ever a binary password sent, the Puppeteer expected red signs. Narcolept quickly threw his down where the Heart of Spears was last seen, and was promptly summoned.</p>
    <p>What followed was a fight with new, improved Heart of Spears. Visually it stayed very similar to its first appearance, the only notable change being Iron Dragonslayer Leggings being replaced with Lorian&rsquo;s (we suspect it was to add the stylish cape). One weapon was added - a Golden Ritual Spear with a constant orange lightning buff, which is most likely the buff from the Dragonslayer Swordspear. The real improvement was the addition of two custom spells to the puppet&rsquo;s arsenal, elevating it from a regular character to a miniboss.</p>
    <p>The spells both utilized Spear Fragment&rsquo;s lightning spears (which we&rsquo;ll refer to as &ldquo;Fragment&rsquo;s Spears&rdquo;, else this paragraph would get really messy). This reinforced the idea that Heart of Spears was previously a Spear of the Church (moreover, as brought up during Oden&rsquo;s dream, it&rsquo;s likely to be the very first Spear of the Church). First spell spawned a line of Spear Fragment&rsquo;s Spears the same way a regular Spear Fragment would. The difference being that it had no cooldown, which meant that Heart of Spears was capable of quickly gaining control over the environment. The second spell was a modified Sunlight Spear, which spawned several Fragment&rsquo;s Spears on launch. While they did not do a lot of damage, this modification proved itself valuable, as it shut down anyone trying to roll through the Sunlight Spear to get very close to the Puppet.</p>

    <p>New, improved version of Heart of Spears appeared. The Puppeteer did not send any poems, instead DM&rsquo;ing Narc and Jean with an in-game screenshot, picturing the Heart of Spears resting near a broken statue in the Ringed City. It&rsquo;s worth noting that Narc&rsquo;s screenshot was labeled &ldquo;2.&rdquo;, and Jean&rsquo;s &ldquo;1.&rdquo;. The meaning of that is unknown.</p>
    <p>Discord members put their signs down by the Spear of the Church bossfog, and Heart of Spears summoned them to fight.</p>

    <h1 class="chapter-title">IX. The Humanity</h1>
    <p class="chapter-desc">March 10, 2018
        <br>Nameless Flame</p>

    <p>After a time of relative calm, composed of several &ldquo;silent&rdquo; events and Oden&rsquo;s dream, March 10 came at us with all guns blazing. Despite the story extending for a while longer, this day would become the first herald of the end.</p>
    <p>The event began with the Puppeteer sending poems <span class="tooltip">#61<span class="tooltiptext ref61"></span></span> and <span class="tooltip">#62<span class="tooltiptext ref62"></span></span>.</p>
    <p>The former foreshadowed the finale of the story: death of Soul of Cinders. The first mention of the Father&rsquo;s ambition was many weeks ago, in <span class="tooltip">#8<span class="tooltiptext ref8"></span></span>, but this poem is the first one to use the name &ldquo;Great Old Sin&rdquo;. This name would become very important during the final event of the game. Also, the &ldquo;one who rides to war&rdquo; against Great Old Sin is almost certainly referring to the final puppet we would face during said event.</p>
    <p>The latter poem is informative, giving us a heads-up about the real event starting in six hours (2/8 of a day, though the Puppeteer had misspelled &ldquo;eighths&rdquo;). Also, a curious point: ‘Show’, ‘an act’, ‘actors’ all invoke the idea of a theater show, which is fitting for the name “Puppeteer”. </p>
    <p>As expected, exactly 6 hours later poem <span class="tooltip">#63<span class="tooltiptext ref63"></span></span> announced the beginning of this tragic event.</p>
    <p>Nameless Flame’s existence has been morbid from the beginning. Birthed from the two unwilling souls forced together into one corpse, it&rsquo;s short-lived outburst of rage as Wraithflame Erik was quickly crushed, leaving behind naught but a hollow husk. The Father was hardly concerned with the emotions of his puppets. The thing he was after was much more basic, more fundamental, more primal. This &ldquo;thing&rdquo; has been the reason father made Redflame Erik and Lone Darkwraith into his puppets, this is the reason for Nameless Flame&rsquo;s existence altogether. This &ldquo;thing&rdquo; is Humanity.</p>

    <blockquote>This black sprite is called humanity, but little is known about its true nature.
        <br>If the soul is the source of all life, then what distinguishes the humanity we hold within ourselves?
        <br>- Humanity (DS1)
    </blockquote>

    <p>Erik and the Darkwraith are presumably undead, meaning that there is some humanity in them. But it seems the Father was unable to extract it &ldquo;as is&rdquo; - perhaps there wasn&rsquo;t enough of it, or he simply did not possess the tools or skills needed to do that. So, he went a different way - stitching two poor puppets together and stripping them of all things unnecessary. By such process, nothing but Humanity was left to grow and prosper, until the time was right.</p>
    <p>Erik was a pyromancer, Darkwraith used gear of Ringed Knights. This affinity to fire persisted through the stitching and subsequent &ldquo;refinement&rdquo;. It not only persisted, but evolved. As the personalities within were stripped away, the Humanity took control - as a result, Nameless Flame uses predominantly blackflame.</p>

    <blockquote>Be it sorcery or pyromancy, all techniques that infringe on humanity lead to the same place. That is to say, they all seek a will of their own.
        <br>- Black Serpent (DS3)
    </blockquote>

    <p>As signified by <span class="tooltip">#64<span class="tooltiptext ref64"></span></span> and <span class="tooltip">#65<span class="tooltiptext ref65"></span></span>, maturing of the Humanity has brought a change to the Nameless Flame. The puppet was &ldquo;alive&rdquo; by virtue of being possessed with Humanity, which was capable of feeling primal emotions. Nameless flame was aware of its inevitable fate, and the Humanity feared perishing. Found within Untended Graves, it became a stalking hunter, ambushing all those who came to its world. </p>

    <blockquote>They will feels envy, or perhaps love, and despite the inevitable trite and tragic ending, they will sees no alternative, and is driven madly towards its target.
        <br>- Pursuers (DS1)
    </blockquote>

    <p>Sadly, we lost a lot of footage recorded during this event. The only surviving clips is that of Ragg fighting the Flame somewhere near the beginning:</p>

    <button class="collapsible"><i class="fas fa-film"></i>Ragg vs. Nameless Flame<i class="fas fa-angle-double-down" style="float: right;"></i></button>
    <div class="collapsible_content">
        <div class="youtube" data-embed="Sds-yy-QtM8"><div class="play-button"></div></div>
    </div>

    <p>As we kept trying to invade the Nameless Flame, the Father began pondering on the fate of the poor being. In <span class="tooltip">#66<span class="tooltiptext ref66"></span></span>, he deemed growing of Humanity to be a goal worthy of sacrificing two living beings. Why would he need the Humanity to such an extent though? As we have seen (and will continue until the very end), the Father is an artisan. Yet not one who works on arms or trinkets. The Father&rsquo;s craft is working with living creatures - repairing them, stitching them together, and giving birth to artificial lives. Such a craft would require resources, and we&rsquo;ve provided them to the Father in the past. This time was no different - the craftsman was collecting  materials for his biggest, most important craft.</p>
    <p>As the inescapable moment grew closer, Nameless Flame&rsquo;s armor began giving in. He, in a fashion similar to Broken Vagrant, started to break. <span class="tooltip">#67<span class="tooltiptext ref67"></span></span> urged us to keep going, to show no pity to this thing until we retrieved the black flame of Humanity from it.</p>
    <p>Upon breaking down even further, Nameless Flame began &ldquo;leaking&rdquo; onto its opponents. Those damaged by it had their weapons forcefully buffed with blackflame, and later even acquired the humanity heads:</p>

    <img src="assets/images/180310_screenshot0.jpg" data-action="zoom"/>
    <img src="assets/images/180310_screenshot1.jpg" data-action="zoom"/>
    <img src="assets/images/180310_screenshot2.jpg" data-action="zoom"/>

    <p>Nearing the end of its life, the puppet leaked blackflame not only onto us, but into the surroundings as well, in form of small black fire orbs. Father described them as &ldquo;cold as ice&rdquo; in <span class="tooltip">#68<span class="tooltiptext ref68"></span></span>. The poem also suggested that the Humanity &ldquo;overflows from greatest kings&rdquo;. The intended meaning of this is unclear, perhaps it&rsquo;s referring to Father having a high opinion of kings of Men from Dark Souls 2?</p>

    <img src="assets/images/180310_screenshot3.jpg" data-action="zoom"/>

    <p><span class="tooltip">#69<span class="tooltiptext ref69"></span></span> reiterates the goal set by the Father in <span class="tooltip">#8<span class="tooltiptext ref8"></span></span> and <span class="tooltip">#61<span class="tooltiptext ref61"></span></span>. At the time we did not understand the meaning of these poems clearly, but in hindsight they are written in clear text. The Father himself says: &ldquo;My goal is clear - undo the Sin&rdquo;.</p>
    <p>Why exactly would he desire to overthrow the Great Old Sin (Soul of Cinders)? The obvious reason would be to gain its power. Yet, as we would learn at the very end of the story, this was not the case for the Puppeteer. This meticulously calculated plan was his way of undoing the damage the Age of Fire has brought upon the world, and setting the world towards the right path, as per the Father&rsquo;s own judgment.</p>
    <p>Nameless Flame could not sustain the continuous damage, and eventually gave up and collapsed, leaving behind the Humanity we all sought to obtain. Poem <span class="tooltip">#70<span class="tooltiptext ref70"></span></span> signified the end of the event, completely eliminated Nameless Flame, and &ldquo;sealed Great Old Sin&rsquo;s fate&rdquo;. The Humanity was also the first of several items we would physically &ldquo;receive&rdquo; in the form of images:</p>

    <h1 class="chapter-title">X. Spark of Yore</h1>
    <p class="chapter-desc">March 12–18, 2018
        <br>Lord of Hail</p>

    <p>With the Nameless Flame gone, we were starting to wonder what puppets we would encounter next. The only active one left was Heart of Spears. Would there be new puppets coming in?</p>
    <p>The Puppeteer had a plan. In the duration of a week starting on March 12 we have received lines <span class="tooltip">#71<span class="tooltiptext ref71"></span></span>, <span class="tooltip">#72<span class="tooltiptext ref72"></span></span>, <span class="tooltip">#73<span class="tooltiptext ref73"></span></span>, <span class="tooltip">#74<span class="tooltiptext ref74"></span></span>, <span class="tooltip">#75<span class="tooltiptext ref75"></span></span>. While they do not line up to be a poem, they share a common theme and style, and as such should be regarded as one thing.</p>
    <p>The one-liners described a violent rainstorm slowly creeping towards us. Beginning somewhere at the horizon, it &ldquo;crawled closer&rdquo;, culminating in the sun being covered by lead clouds.</p>
    <p>Soon after <span class="tooltip">#75<span class="tooltiptext ref75"></span></span> was sent, the Father spoke with <span class="tooltip">#76<span class="tooltiptext ref76"></span></span>. By our hand something terribly old was unearthed, that which was &ldquo;long lost in time&rdquo;. Surely this was the beginning of a new event.</p>
    <p>We began searching for this puppet, discussing in parallel who it could be. Heart of Spears was suggested as the simplest answer - it had an affinity for lightning. Another suggestion was that it was the &ldquo;titan Lord of Thunder&rdquo; which was referenced a long time ago in poems <span class="tooltip">#27<span class="tooltiptext ref27"></span></span>, <span class="tooltip">#31<span class="tooltiptext ref31"></span></span>, <span class="tooltip">#32<span class="tooltiptext ref32"></span></span>. Could we expect to be facing the very Lord that has subdued the Heart of Spears eons ago?</p>
    <p>As it turned out, we could. Kallah was the first person to find the puppet in question. We weren&rsquo;t facing Heart of Spears or Slumbering Oden, but <i>Lord of Hail</i>.</p>
    <p>After a quick fight at the storming Great Belfry, poem <span class="tooltip">#77<span class="tooltiptext ref77"></span></span> was sent, which in hindsight gave us a clear answer at the identity of the new puppet. Sent from Lord of Hail&rsquo;s perspective, it was italicized - meaning we were facing Oden, awoken from his deep slumber. (Another small detail - as seen during Oden&rsquo;s dream, the puppet used archaic words in its speech - a pattern that would continue with Lord of Hail).</p>
    <p>As per Kallah&rsquo;s first impression, Lord of Hail had a hefty amount of health (which seemed to increase in proportion to the amount of invaders in his world) and could be invaded by several people at once. Astora Greatsword with Neck Swipe was straight out of Slumbering Oden&rsquo;s arsenal, but it was also augmented by a Drakeblood Greatsword with Storm Ruler&rsquo;s weapon art, and Storm Curved Sword. Akin to Nameless Flame and Heart of Spears, Lord of Hail had two custom spells. The first was a quick burst of wind that would knock the opponents down. The second - a violent wind blast with a damaging fire orb.</p>

    <div class="collapsible_content">
        <div class="youtube" data-embed="wmPxKCQXQhU"><div class="play-button"></div></div>
    </div>
    <p>The Lord continued his monologue in <span class="tooltip">#78<span class="tooltiptext ref78"></span></span>, lamenting on how degraded the world around him has become - &ldquo;naught left but cinders long deranged&rdquo;. The race referenced in the last line is unclear - it could be the race of old Gods, whose rule had brought the world to such a pitiful state. It could also be the race of Men, many of who were also afraid of ushering the Age of Dark.</p>
    <p>Shortly after <span class="tooltip">#78<span class="tooltiptext ref78"></span></span>, Lord of Hail started using a very peculiar miracle. He would create a stationary floating ball of light\wind. It could be best described by the icon of Wrath of the Gods, but as an in-game particle. It did no damage, but Lord was eager to keep people away from it.</p>
    <p>These wind spheres were not a spell on their own, but rather a part of a spell. During one of the next fights, he held two fingers up and vanished into thin air, reappearing shortly afterwards near the wind sphere. That&rsquo;s right - Lord of Hail possessed the ability to teleport himself. It was a very powerful ability, as he became invulnerable even during the starting animation. It was, however, used sparingly, and mostly seems to be the Puppeteer&rsquo;s way to give this puppet a way out of fighting up to 5 people simultaneously - not a way to get out of any slightest danger.</p>
    <p>The Father spoke again in poem <span class="tooltip">#79<span class="tooltiptext ref79"></span></span>, rejoicing at the return of the ancient Lord, and at the fate that would await him. The idea that Lord of Hail is not a true Lord reborn, but a final spark quickly dying down would be further reinforced in the final poems of this event.</p>
    <p>Lord of Hail continued his monologue in <span class="tooltip">#80<span class="tooltiptext ref80"></span></span>, now speaking to us directly. He may have been &ldquo;reborn&rdquo; by reawakening from his long dream and (seemingly) a lifetime of mindless wanderings, but it has certainly taken a toll on his body. Nevertheless, the &ldquo;eye&rdquo; for which he was not forgiven so long ago (<span class="tooltip">#55<span class="tooltiptext ref55"></span></span>) didn&rsquo;t suffer the cruel hands of time. This &ldquo;eye&rdquo; can be interpreted in several ways: it may mean his mind and the wisdom accumulated through eons of life. It could also very literally mean his right eye. As we will see at the end of his final event, his right eye is glowing bright blue.</p>
    <p>After this poem, the Lord became much more aggressive in combat, also summoning all the red signs he could find.</p>

    </div>
    <p>Poem <span class="tooltip">#81<span class="tooltiptext ref81"></span></span> echoes back to Oden&rsquo;s dream, and yet again confirms Lord&rsquo;s tremendous age: &ldquo;Once proudly stood in sunlit halls, then wandered them, destroyed by frost&rdquo; is almost certainly referring to Anor Londo from the times of Lordran and Lothric. There isn&rsquo;t much else to be extracted from this poem.</p>
    <p>As the event went on, poem <span class="tooltip">#82<span class="tooltiptext ref82"></span></span> switches back to Father&rsquo;s perspective. Here we reaffirm that the Lord is not a human in nature. &ldquo;Born of the flame&rdquo;, old enough to have known Gwyn&rsquo;s first title, bearing the title of a Lord himself - Oden is none other than a derelict god! And a curious god at that - wishing for the end of the reign of his own kind. Yet as we&rsquo;ve seen for a while now, he clearly opposed the unnatural prolongation of the Age of Fire, calling Gwyn himself a &ldquo;feeble coward&rdquo; in <span class="tooltip">#56<span class="tooltiptext ref56"></span></span>.</p>
    <p>The event continued without any noteworthy things happening: Lord kept summoning people and being invaded, frequently engaging his opponents in gruesome 5v1s. </p>
    <p>In poem <span class="tooltip">#83<span class="tooltiptext ref83"></span></span> the Lord shows that he is fully aware of his fate and of his purpose in the Father&rsquo;s plan. He is the most talkative puppet we&rsquo;ve had throughout the whole event, it&rsquo;s not unbelievable that the Father had shared with him the full extent of his plan. Why Oden decided to go with it is another question - perhaps he was aware that even with him being an ancient god, he would not be capable of overthrowing the Soul of Cinders. Or perhaps, in the event that he did, the Father did not desire him to acquire the power such a victory would yield. Either way, Lord of Hail was resigned to his fate. (Another curious remark - it seems that puppet&rsquo;s time as Oden the Armless was Oden being mad\hollow, as stated by the second line).</p>
    <p>The event ended with poem <span class="tooltip">#84<span class="tooltiptext ref84"></span></span>, confirming all that has been already said. Oden, Lord of Hail is an ancient Lord, from eons when Lordran was likely still prosperous. For decades upon decades he has been wandering the world, losing himself and his memories in the process. The Father found him and decided that he was a valuable puppet. By calculated design or lucky improvisation, stitching with the White Vagrant had sent Oden&rsquo;s  mind down the memory lane. And now, restored in mind but not in body, he is a witness to the dead end that the Age of Fire had brought upon this world. Powerless to change that, his one choice is to leave his fate in the hands of the Father. And as the last line of the poem tells us, this fate may be darker than a mere death, as it&rsquo;s truly &ldquo;fit for forlorn&rdquo;.</p>

    <h1 class="chapter-title">XI. Of Bits and Pixels</h1>
    <p class="chapter-desc">March 25, 2018</p>

    <p>A curious side-track of the story began on March 25.</p>
    <p>Narcolept received a message from the puppeteer, which said just &ldquo;... For far too long to it we bowed,&rdquo;. Shortly after, Kallah had gotten &ldquo;. The wheel is turning, my dear crowd!&rdquo;. By then it was fairly obvious that this would be another poem, only sent in a very disjointed way.</p>
    <p>The notion was furthered when WeHaveLifdoff received &ldquo;.... its time had passed so long agone&rdquo;. The question arose - how to arrange the lines so that it makes the original poem? The first proposed variant:</p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">For far too long to it we bowed,
        <br>.
        <br>The wheel is turning, my dear crowd!
        <br>its time has passed so long agone.</p>
    <p>That is because the Puppeteer&rsquo;s poems were always (well, aside perhaps from some very early ones) written in ABAB format. Therefore the lines Kallah and Narc had received would have another line in-between them.</p>
    <p>Initial proposition was rebuffed due to last two lines not working together grammatically. Therefore, a second one was made:</p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">The wheel is turning, my dear crowd!
        <br>.
        <br>For far too long to it we bowed,
        <br>its time has passed so long agone.</p>
    <p>This felt better, and the what remained was to get the missing line. Tikaro had gotten &ldquo;.. Great Sin with you we shall dethrone!&rdquo; shortly after, thusly completing poem <span class="tooltip">#86<span class="tooltiptext ref86"></span></span>. As you can see, the saved poem differs from the second proposal. In hindsight, the periods in the beginnings of the lines likely refer to their place in the poem as intended by the Puppeteer. But we have decided that the order in which <span class="tooltip">#86<span class="tooltiptext ref86"></span></span> is saved sounded more naturally.</p>
    <p>The fairly straightforward poem is again referencing advancements within the Father&rsquo;s plan to kill the Great Old Sin (Soul of Cinders) and lift its oppressive influence from the world. We are also witnessing more references to the Sin, as we are coming closer to the final big event of the story.</p>
    <p>Shortly after we have settled on the order in which to save the poem, a most peculiar image was sent to every discord channel, as well as to many members in private messages (<span class="tooltip">#87<span class="tooltiptext ref87"></span></span>):</p>

    <img src="assets/images/180325_encryption_big0.png"  data-action="zoom"/>

    <p>An encoding! That much was obvious immediately, but what exactly was encoded, and how to get it out? Best way to go about it was to analyze the initial image and see how much information we could get. Beware, this will get technical.</p>
    <p>The full dimensions were 32px by 100px. It consisted of two long 16px wide and 76px tall strips and two hints at the bottom. The left stripe was colored, the right one had only transparent and black pixels. First hint has shown pure RGBA colors transforming into pure white pixels. Second hint seemingly swapped 0s and 1s around.</p>
    <p>From this much we could gather that the information encoded could have been in binary (due to the second hint). Moreover, Puppeteer has been fond of using binary in his poems for numbering. The initial idea was to simply bucket fill all colored pixels with white, as well as all transparent. This yielded nothing of worth.</p>
    <p>What followed was a series of what could be amounted to blind guessing. We have tried various permutations of bucket filling different colors with white or black in the left strip, and overlaying the right strip on it afterwards. Some results gave rise to interesting patterns, others just looked like white noise.</p>
    <p>The analysis continued with realization that the colors on the left strip were 100% pure, with no semitones used. Colors used were all the permutations of 255 red, 155 green, 255 blue that could be made.</p>
    <p>Early on in our decrypting pursuit we have realized that we were in need of some way to check our results. Manipulating the image was easy, but how to extract information from it? Alex had suggested a straightforward binary to ASCII text converter. But first, we needed to convert the image itself into binary. This is not a difficult problem - just map black pixels to 0, white pixels to 1. But with at least a 16x72 image, that&rsquo;s a lot of manual typing to do. We weren&rsquo;t going to do that, and instead used an online converter we had quickly found (https://www.dcode.fr/binary-image). </p>
    <p>Next question was how to map a 2D pixel image onto a 1D line of bits. The most conventional way would be to read it like a book: left-to-right, top-to-bottom. This is the way we had decided to do it.</p>
    <p>Unsuccessful in our previous attempts, we tried separating the RGB channels from each other. In hindsight this was the right way to go about it, but we had not realized that for a fair while longer.</p>

    <img src="assets/images/180325_decoding0.png"  data-action="zoom"/>

    <p>The first day of decoding was unsuccessful, and we went on.</p>
    <p>On the second day, Ensign Epic had received an additional encoding from the Puppeteer (<span class="tooltip">#88<span class="tooltiptext ref88"></span></span>):</p>

    <img src="assets/images/180325_encryption_big1.png" data-action="zoom"/>

    <p>This one a fair bit smaller and had just two 16x16 black and white squares on it. It was cracked almost immediately, and revealed a simple message: <code>L O S E N O T A S I N G L E B I T</code>. This has proven to be an important find, as it had confirmed what we were suspecting: the information that was encoded was ascii text in binary format, later encoded as pixels. 0s mapped to blacks, 1s to whites.</p>
    <p>In parallel to this, Fanboy had sent the Puppeteer a fairly large poem, highly praising all of his work:</p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">Pardon my rudeness, as thine request
        <br>I did not see in time - a shame
        <br>Too tired I was - had to rest
        <br>resulting in a showing lame
        <br>
        <br>Each time you&rsquo;ve offered bouts of skill
        <br>amusement to those bound by death
        <br>A chance to show our Ashen Will
        <br>and fight until one draws no breath
        <br>
        <br>The shows you put on - they amaze
        <br>all of the times that I&rsquo;ve observed
        <br>Impossible, it is to turn ones gaze:
        <br>Indeed you have your praise deserved!
        <br>
        <br>A cryptic image we&rsquo;ve received
        <br>a work of yours to test our mind
        <br>Prevail we will, won&rsquo;t be deceived,
        <br>and find we shall the puppet-kind!</p>
    <p>As a response, the Puppeteer had sent him the same small encryption he sent to Ensign, along with poem <span class="tooltip">#89<span class="tooltiptext ref89"></span></span>. The former half had thanked Fanboy for the praise and the fact that it was sent in poems. The latter gave more lore on the state of the world - a dominant theme of this period of the story.</p>
    <p>Additional encoding has spurred up more discussions about what we could do with the main one, and it almost seemed like we understood how to find the solution now. But the problem of converting colored parts to white still remained.</p>
    <p>Next followed the ideas about separating the colors out, and trying to manipulate them in some way. Unsuccessful, we took another look at the additional encoding.</p>
    <p>Narcolept had quickly converted one line of a poem into binary, hoping to see some sort of a pattern in the bits:</p>
    <code>01000110 01101111
        01110010 00100000
        01100110 01100001
        01110010 00100000
        01110100 01101111
        01101111 00100000
        01101100 01101111
        01101110 01100111
        00100000 01110100
        01101111 00100000
        01101001 01110100
        00100000 01110111
        01100101 00100000
        01100010 01101111
        01110111 01100101
        01100100 00101100</code>
    <p>And pattern we did see - a single character (which is represented by 8 bits, so 01010000 for example is &ldquo;P&rdquo;) never had a 1 as its left-most bit. This meant that we would expect to see long vertical black stripes on the correctly decoded image.</p>

    <p>More unsuccessful brainstorming ensued. The progress was made in face of the idea that we would expect long black stripes to appear on a good image. Still, the encoding remained uncracked.</p>
    <p>Next day, Terrid had received yet another small encoding, with the Puppeteer slowly nudging us towards the right solution (<span class="tooltip">#90<span class="tooltiptext ref90"></span></span>, left half):</p>

    <img src="assets/images/180325_encryption_big2.png" data-action="zoom"/>

    <p>What some had thought to be a smaller version of the main code, was in fact a completely new message. This is also the time we finally made a separate discord channel for the Puppeteer&rsquo;s story, back then mostly a way to not flood other channels with our attempts at decoding the main image.</p>
    <p>Yet more analysis came forth, with us trying to do everything we did with the main encoding, but on this small one. The encoding held steadfast. We would get to the bottom of it soon, but first, another event followed...</p>

    <h1 class="chapter-title">XII. Heart Attack</h1>
    <p class="chapter-desc">March 30, 2018
        <br>Heart of Spears</p>

    <p>On the last Friday of the month, we were to witness the final event for one of the most beloved puppets - the Heart of Spears.</p>
    <p>Poem <span class="tooltip">#91<span class="tooltiptext ref91"></span></span> kicked things off early on in the day. The Father&rsquo;s lamenting over the sorry state of the world is yet again reinforced, as is his terminating role in its story. As we were getting closer and closer to the final act of the story, the Puppeteer has been making this increasingly clear - we all knew the end was coming soon.</p>
    <p>Later on in the day, <span class="tooltip">#92<span class="tooltiptext ref92"></span></span> announced the beginning of the event and gave us a clear goal to fulfill (in the same way poem <span class="tooltip">#63<span class="tooltiptext ref63"></span></span> urged us to harvest the Humanity from the Nameless Flame). The &ldquo;sunlit vessel&rdquo; would become a metaphor for the Heart&rsquo;s corpse from here on onwards, and will be strengthened even more at the end of the event.</p>
    <p>Not by coincidence, what we would bring back today was directly related to said Humanity - &ldquo;the forceful light of life pitch-black, it matters not without a frame.&rdquo; As we already know from <span class="tooltip">#68<span class="tooltiptext ref68"></span></span>, in the Puppeteer&rsquo;s story Humanity is the source of life much in the same way the Souls are. Yet just a raw shard of it cannot manifest itself into anything useful - it needs a corpse to animate.</p>
    <p><span class="tooltip">#93<span class="tooltiptext ref93"></span></span> gave an obvious clue as to the location we were to search in: &ldquo;the streets of gold&rdquo; is a direct description of the Ringed City. Moreover, this is the only place Heart of Spears had been seen. And just as expected, we had found it:</p>

    <button class="collapsible"><i class="fas fa-film"></i>Ensign vs. Heart of Spears<i class="fas fa-angle-double-down" style="float: right;"></i></button>
    <div class="collapsible_content">
        <div class="youtube" data-embed="3QBwvYVIgI4"><div class="play-button"></div></div>
        <div class="youtube" data-embed="SjyZacBvSuw"><div class="play-button"></div></div>
    </div>

    <p>Soon after invading the Heart, we realized that one thing would be different this time. Just as <span class="tooltip">#90<span class="tooltiptext ref90"></span></span> said, the Heart would &ldquo;wander&rdquo; away from the Halflight boss fog. Where to? We did not know yet, but the fact that it was slowly moving was obvious.</p>

    <button class="collapsible"><i class="fas fa-film"></i>Kallah vs. Heart of Spears<i class="fas fa-angle-double-down" style="float: right;"></i></button>
    <div class="collapsible_content">
        <div class="youtube" data-embed="xKKCxmzsSL4"><div class="play-button"></div></div>
    </div>

    <p>As several of us pointed out, the Heart had also become more aggressive and rabid in comparison to previous appearances.</p>
    <p>Poem <span class="tooltip">#94<span class="tooltiptext ref94"></span></span> continues the Father&rsquo;s wondering. The Heart is undoubtedly ancient, having lived through the foundation of the Spears of the Church. Was it by chance the founder of it? The previous poems, such as <span class="tooltip">#58<span class="tooltiptext ref58"></span></span> and <span class="tooltip">#60<span class="tooltiptext ref60"></span></span>, strongly suggest that it&rsquo;s the <b>first</b> Spear, but is it also the driving force behind the covenant? We would never get an answer, nevertheless it&rsquo;s an interesting idea.</p>
    <p>The poem also mentions the Heart&rsquo;s dream. <span class="tooltip">#27<span class="tooltiptext ref27"></span></span>, which introduced the puppet, had also mentioned it waking from its slumber. The dream seems to have been not like Oden&rsquo;s Dream of recollection, but a more severe one akin to death. We know that it was induced by the titan Lord by impaling the puppet through its chest with the &ldquo;cyclopean spear&rdquo;.</p>
    <p>Another note - there is an overarching theme of &ldquo;great beings fallen out of grace&rdquo; in the Heart of Spears, Oden, and all of the initial puppets as well. Certainly makes the story fit the Dark Souls universe, which is also known for the same motif.</p>

    <button class="collapsible"><i class="fas fa-film"></i>Ensign vs. Heart of Spears<i class="fas fa-angle-double-down" style="float: right;"></i></button>
    <div class="collapsible_content">
        <div class="youtube" data-embed="PlAfFsgCWVs"><div class="play-button"></div></div>
        <div class="youtube" data-embed="UgzObX9Dv0c"><div class="play-button"></div></div>
    </div>

    <p>As the event went on, and the puppet reached Gwyn&rsquo;s statue in the Ringed City, poem <span class="tooltip">#95<span class="tooltiptext ref95"></span></span> was dropped. The Father recollects what we already saw in <span class="tooltip">#60<span class="tooltiptext ref60"></span></span> from another perspective. The first Spear of the Church was with no doubt a mighty and ferocious being of great renown. And ever yet, this fearless, strong, sunlit creature was forced reduced to an unmoving corpse by the titan Lord.</p>
    <p>(Stepping slightly off-topic: We are certain that the &ldquo;titan Lord&rdquo; is Oden, Lord of Hail. The recurring mentions of how he overpowered the Heart of Spears suggest that he was a frightfully strong being as well, during that ancient period.)</p>
    <p>And ever still, perhaps because it laid dead for eons or just by virtue of the passage of time, the Heart&rsquo;s soul and mind have been reduced to fading scraps. Poems <span class="tooltip">#96<span class="tooltiptext ref96"></span></span> and <span class="tooltip">#97<span class="tooltiptext ref97"></span></span>, sent in quick succession, urged us to void its corpse from them.</p>
    <p>There are a couple of interesting points in these last poems. Starting with <span class="tooltip">#96<span class="tooltiptext ref96"></span></span>, it mentions &ldquo;last Father&rsquo;s vow&rdquo;. What does it precisely mean? From <span class="tooltip">#32<span class="tooltiptext ref32"></span></span> we know that the Father had &ldquo;made sure&rdquo; the Heart would remain dormant until his plan was advanced enough. It could refer to the Heart&rsquo;s corpse being the last &ldquo;real&rdquo; resource the Father needed for his plan. As we know from <span class="tooltip">#82<span class="tooltiptext ref82"></span></span>, Oden, Lord of Hail offering himself as a sacrifice for the Father is only a matter of time now, so obtaining the Heart&rsquo;s corpse would be the only step that still had to be made.</p>
    <p>As Ensign pointed out, <span class="tooltip">#97<span class="tooltiptext ref97"></span></span> has a cute wordplay at the very end. A &ldquo;light mare&rdquo; could refer to the wanderings of the Heart, as it daydreams throughout this whole event, recollecting the zenith of its life during its last fleeting moments. Not the worst way to go, but certainly not the best either.</p>

    <p>The Heart wandered on along the Midir&rsquo;s bridge, and into the Shared Grave. Our hunch was that it was going towards the Purging Monument - the very first place where it was found, and also the place for resurrecting Spears of the Church.</p>
    <p>During the last fight of the event, <span class="tooltip">#98<span class="tooltiptext ref98"></span></span> was the last bits of lore we would ever get on the Heart of Spears. Again it references the Heart&rsquo;s death-like dream, and at last we get a glimpse of its nature. The dream was that of the Abyss, likely indicating that the titan Lord of Thunder possessed\nurtured within himself an affinity for the dark. Or, which is perhaps more likely as indicated by <span class="tooltip">#31<span class="tooltiptext ref31"></span></span>, the Lord&rsquo;s cyclopean spear was likely imbued with potent occult powers. The Heart, having always existed in the bright sunlight of the Gods, had a great weakness to this wholly opposite force.</p>
    <p>The puppet, torn, tired, and broken, found its eternal respite in the deep chamber of the Shared Grave. There we found it motionless and mangled. The Father was, undoubtedly, content, as we saw in the closing poem <span class="tooltip">#99<span class="tooltiptext ref99"></span></span>.</p>

    <p>Along with the final poem, we found the Vessel, which is, supposedly, how the Puppeteer decided to show Heart&rsquo;s corpse in the form of an item. Much like the Humanity, this was a precious resources for the Father, and a reward for us. (Technically speaking, the Vessel is a modification of the Basin of Vows from vanilla DS3)</p>

    <img src="assets/images/180330_vessel.png" data-action="zoom"/>

    <p>And so, the Heart of Spears was no more. With Humanity and the Vessel obtained, and Oden&rsquo;s submission being just a matter of time, we have stepped on the straight path to the finale of the Puppeteer&rsquo;s story, which had by now become an important part of our community. Several people have even said out loud that it was a highlight of their Dark Souls experience.</p>
    <p>In a manner befitting such sentiments, <span class="tooltip">#100<span class="tooltiptext ref100"></span></span> talks about the Father&rsquo;s philosophy and of his grand plan. Caught in the endless cycles of Fire and Dark, simply bringing upon the next Age would do nothing in the grand scheme of things. And so the Father knows - to &ldquo;make sure our prints for eons last&rdquo;, a different, more fundamental change to the world must be made.</p>

    <h1 class="chapter-title">XIII. The Timeline</h1>
    <p class="chapter-desc">April 1, 2018</p>

    <p>While no events played out during this day nor was the narrative advanced any further, something important has happened. On April 1, we have decoded the Puppeteer&rsquo;s encodings.</p>
    <p>Early on, Narcolept and Tikaro have received the following image from the Puppeteer, sent via DMs (<span class="tooltip">#90<span class="tooltiptext ref90"></span></span>, right half):</p>

    <img src="assets/images/180325_encryption_big3.png" data-action="zoom"/>

    <p>It was a copy of the previous small encoding, only with a different hint this time. The hint was quickly analyzed: at a first glance, it was a map of all of the colors from the encodings to their RGB components.</p>

    <img src="assets/images/180401_decoding0.png" data-action="zoom"/>

    <p>We have quickly realized that the Puppeteer wanted us to isolate RGB channels of the encodings and stitch them back together, now as black-and-white strips only. This only left one question - what to do with the black-and-transparent mask which both the main encoding and this small one had?</p>
    <p>The second part of the hint on this new version of the small encoding gave us the answer:</p>

    <img src="assets/images/180401_decoding1.png" data-action="zoom"/>

    <p>While at first sight it&rsquo;s just 4 pixels, this was actually the rule with which we had to order the isolated channels to decode the image successfully. We had red, green, and blue channels. The missing one? Black-and-transparent.</p>
    <p>Upon this realization, the small encoding was quickly cracked. The image produced looked like this:</p>

    <img src="assets/images/180401_decoding2.png" data-action="zoom"/>

    <p>And the information within was:<code>IAMTHEEND&lt;0&gt;</code> What did it mean? This we would understand upon decoding the main image.</p>
    <p>The information we now had about the encoding process was enough to crack the big one. There was a single bump in the road - in the main encryption, not the whole RGB channels had to be stitched together in the &ldquo;Red, Green, Blue, Transparent&rdquo; order, but rather a single 1-pixel wide strip from each of the channels had to be repeat the pattern. This produced an image seen below:</p>

    <img src="assets/images/180401_decoding3.png" data-action="zoom"/>

    <p>What we uncovered was not a poem, nor a readable piece of text. It was another cryptic string of characters, holding a lot of information in a very compact way:</p>

    <pre><code>[[[|&lt;1&gt;&lt;2&gt;&lt;3&gt;&lt;4&gt;|-

    <p>Now, what exactly were we looking at? We were certain it was the correct decoding - it looked too ordered, and there were &ldquo;&lt;YOU&gt;&rdquo; symbols popping up everywhere.</p>
    <p>The first step towards understanding the decoded information was to parse it. We weren&rsquo;t sure what it was supposed to mean, but we did see that there was a lot of whitespace character noise in it. So, first thing we did was get rid of them. Narcolept had also conveniently split it at every arrow:</p>

    <pre><code>[[[

    <p>Now this was beginning to look as it had some meaning. &ldquo;&lt;YOU&gt;&rdquo; was the element that caught our attention immediately. The first interpretation, and the one we used ever since was that &ldquo;&lt;YOU&gt;&rdquo; meant &ldquo;server members that participated in the Puppeteer&rsquo;s story&rdquo;.</p>
    <p>This, in turn, gave Ensign an idea that <#> elements could be referring to the puppets we have been encountering. If he was right, line <code>-->|&lt;1&gt;-x-&lt;YOU&gt;|&|&lt;2&gt;-x-&lt;YOU&gt;|&|&lt;3&gt;-x-&lt;YOU&gt;|&|&lt;4&gt;-x-&lt;YOU&gt;|</code> was referring to us fighting and beating the four original puppets. From here we could gather that <code>|&lt;1&gt;-x-&lt;YOU&gt;|</code> meant &ldquo;&lt;puppet 1&gt; encountered/killed by &lt;us&gt;&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Going with this idea, the very first meaningful line <code>|&lt;1&gt;&lt;2&gt;&lt;3&gt;&lt;4&gt;|</code> meant that the first four puppets made their appearance. A &ldquo;declaration of variables&rdquo; of sorts.</p>
    <p>We then observed that <code>|&lt;2&gt;&lt;3&gt;-->&lt;5&gt;|</code> likely signified Lone Darkwraith and Redflame Erik being stitched together into Wraithflame Erik.</p>
    <p>Now, if the first four puppets had their tokens/variables start counting at 1, what did <code>&lt;0&gt;</code> mean? Remember <code>IAMTHEEND&lt;0&gt;</code>? &lt;0&gt; was <b>the final puppet</b>, and the whole string of information was detailing the Father&rsquo;s plan to make it.</p>
    <p>We were excited to uncover so much information. Quickly, we have started to meticulously go through what would now be referred to as the Timeline, and interpret every line, checking it against the real-life chronology of the Puppeteer&rsquo;s events we have been keeping updated.</p>
    <p>And it was lining up. <code>-->|&lt;2&gt;&lt;3&gt;-->&lt;5&gt;|&|&lt;4&gt;-x-&lt;YOU&gt;|</code> meant &ldquo;pLone Darkwraith and Redflame Erik made into Wraithflame Erik] AND [White Vagrant fought us]&rdquo; Subsequently, <code>>|&lt;4&gt;-->x|&|&lt;6&gt;|</code> was interpreted as &ldquo;[White Vagrant died] AND [Heart of Spears appeared]&rdquo; We won&rsquo;t write out interpretations of each line here, they will all be at the end of this section nearly formatted. Now, let&rsquo;s focus on what we already understood about the Timeline and what we were yet to figure out. Having quickly cross-referenced our document with it, we were able to determine which tokens belong to which puppets. Thus, a much more readable version of the Timeline came to be:</p>

    <p>Now, the Timeline was beginning to take shape. There was, however, several more things we did not understand in its syntax. </p>
    <p>A realization that struck us was that the arrows at the start of each line had variable lengths. We never gave it much thought afterwards, but the general consensus was that it meant different periods of time between the events.</p><p>
    <p>First puzzling part was <code>|[1]|</code>. The puppet tokens were written with angle brackets, not with square ones. The first idea was that they meant &ldquo;final ascended puppets&rdquo;. <code>&lt;1&gt;</code> was Oden the Armless&rsquo; token, so <code>[1]</code> would refer to Lord of Hail, right? No, this was not the case, as it did not hold up with <code>&lt;2&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;3&gt;</code> - Lone Darkwraith&rsquo;s and Redflame Erik&rsquo;s tokens, respectively. We knew they became a single being in face of the Nameless Flame, so they could not possibly occupy <code>[2]</code> and <code>[3]</code>.</p>
    <p>We saw line <code>|&lt;Nameless Flame&gt;-->x|>|[1]|</code>, which was the last time we saw Nameless Flame in the Timeline. What happened to the Nameless Flame after we killed it? We obtained the Humanity. So the next, (and this time correct), interpretation was that <code>[#]</code> Father&rsquo;s precious resources.</p>
    <p>Next, <code>&mdash;-->...</code>. This was quickly decided to be the &ldquo;current place in the timeline&rdquo;, as of April 1. This made sense and lined up with what we have documented.</p>
    <p>Here we ran into a slight problem: we have just killed Heart of Spears and obtained its Vessel (which was expected to be <code>[2]</code>, yet there was nothing like <code>|&lt;Heart of Spears&gt;--&gt;x|&gt;|[2]|</code> in the Timeline. (Note: upon writing this final version of the Puppeteer story&rsquo;s chronology it appears that the line <code>&mdash;-->|[2]|&|[3]|</code> refers exactly to that - &ldquo;[[2] obtained] and [[3] obtained]&rdquo; with [2] and [3] being precious resources extracted from Heart of Spears and Lord of Hail respectively).</p>
    <p>Having parsed and interpreted everything up until the &ldquo;current place&rdquo;, we have come to the juiciest part. The Timeline did not end there, but kept going, telling us of the future we were yet to see.</p>
    <p><code>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;>|[1][2][3]&mdash;>&lt;0&gt;|</code> meant &ldquo;Puppet &lt;0&gt; made from [The Humanity], [Heart&rsquo;s Vessel], [Lord of Hail&rsquo;s resource]&rdquo;</p>
    <p><code>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;>|&lt;0&gt;-->...|</code> was interpreted as &ldquo;Puppet &lt;0&gt; UNKNOWN ACTION&rdquo;</p>
    <p><code>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;>|&lt;0&gt;x<>|</code> read &ldquo;Puppet &lt;0&gt; fought(?) <>&rdquo; (Final edit note: this turned out to be more like &ldquo;Puppet &lt;0&gt; CONSUMED <>&rdquo;).</p>
    <p><code>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;>|&lt;0&gt;|</code> at last meant &ldquo;Puppet &lt;0&gt; remained&rdquo;.</p>
    <p>And here, the Timeline ended, meaning that the mysterious puppet &lt;0&gt; was the final thing we would see in this story.</p>
    <p>There was however one last question to be answered: what was the <code><></code>? We have pondered on it for a while, with several suggestions. It could have meant the Father himself, or some other yet unknown entity. What we knew was that it appeared right before the first time we saw the Nameless Flame. But there was nothing aside from a 1-hour break between the Slumbering Oden&rsquo;s only event and the Nameless Flame&rsquo;s first appearance.</p>
    <p>As we have realized much later, <code><></code> was indeed an entity. A nameless &ldquo;puppet&rdquo; of sorts. Not Father&rsquo;s puppet, but rather the puppet of the world, playing on the stage of the Age of Fire and keeping it safe. It was the Great Old Sin, first mentioned precisely right before Nameless Flame&rsquo;s first appearance.</p>
    <p>With this, there was nothing more to discover in the Timeline. The whole, line-by-line interpretation of it can be seen below:</p>

    <h1 class="chapter-title">XIV. Sparks and Corpses</h1>
    <p class="chapter-desc">April 02–22, 2018
        <br>Lord of Hail</p>

    <p>The day after we decoded the Timeline, the Puppeteer has sent us poem <span class="tooltip">#101<span class="tooltiptext ref101"></span></span>. As you can already see, the presentation differed a lot from his usual style.</p>
    <p>The image shown is the most interesting part, no doubt. As we will see later on, this is the first glimpse we get at Father&rsquo;s workshop. In-game location is the room where you meet Siegward in Irithyll, but that is hardly related to the Puppeteer&rsquo;s lore.</p>
    <p>The arm on the right side, hanging in front of the fireplace, is encased in Gundyr&rsquo;s gauntlet. In combination with the result of the recent event, it&rsquo;s not a far-fetched suggestion that this is a glimpse at the Heart of Spears - that is, at its corpse. One heavy drawback to that idea is that the arm is fairly thick in comparison to Heart of Spear&rsquo;s morbidly anorexic proportions.</p>
    <p>The poem also seems to agree with that proposition. Written from Father&rsquo;s perspective, the first two lines talk about an &ldquo;imposing carcass as if from elder wood&rdquo;. We&rsquo;ve seen numerous suggestions that Heart of Spears possesses freakish physical resilience, so it can be imagined that its skin would be quite different from a regular corpse. </p>
    <p>Latter half of the poem sees the Father in wondering or doubts. &ldquo;The goods&rdquo; are ambiguous - is he referring to resources needed to restitch this corpse? Or does he mean his own stitching skills? Either way, the Father still had a job to be done.</p>
    <p><span class="tooltip">#101<span class="tooltiptext ref101"></span></span> was followed by a longer-than-usual period of silence from the Puppeteer. We did not see any events happening for 20 days - up until the end of April. However, several interactions have happened during this time.</p>
    <p>First of them was engaged by Ragg. We have talked about the probability of the Father imbuing Heart of Spears&rsquo; corpse with Nameless Flame&rsquo;s Humanity. During the deaths of both, we have obtained two images - a vessel and a blackflame soul. So—Ragg thought—why not put the one in the other in a very physical sense? And he did exactly that, sending it to the Puppeteer on April 6:</p>

    <img src="assets/images/180406_ragg_vessel.png" data-action="zoom"/>

    <p>Ten days later, we got a reply in poem <span class="tooltip">#102<span class="tooltiptext ref102"></span></span>, sent along with an image:</p>

    <img src="assets/images/180416_humanity_in_vessel.png" data-action="zoom"/>

    <p>The image is a more detailed version of the same idea Ragg had, and the poem has confirmed (albeit in a roundabout manner) that Humanity will indeed be put inside the Heart of Spears&rsquo; corpse. And, once again, it mentions Sin - the main &ldquo;foe&rdquo; of the story from Father&rsquo;s perspective.</p>
    <p>Couple of days later, on April 18, the gears began shifting again. Three people have received three poems in personal messages: Ensign got <span class="tooltip">#103<span class="tooltiptext ref103"></span></span>, Alex got <span class="tooltip">#104<span class="tooltiptext ref104"></span></span>, and Kallah - <span class="tooltip">#105<span class="tooltiptext ref105"></span></span>.</p>
    <p>The Puppeteer took care in conveying meaning not only via the words within his poems, but in their formatting as well. Because of this, we can say with a fair bit of certainty that <span class="tooltip">#103<span class="tooltiptext ref103"></span></span> is a continuation of <span class="tooltip">#102<span class="tooltiptext ref102"></span></span> - both start with ellipses, both are divided by a blank line in the middle. In this poem Father describes the state of the Heart of Spears&rsquo; corpse - heavily scarred from it&rsquo;s profoundly long life. The last line is interesting - &ldquo;scrape the stars&rdquo; suggests that, despite now being devoid of life, an epic fate still awaits the corpse.</p>
    <p><span class="tooltip">#104<span class="tooltiptext ref104"></span></span> switches the perspective from the Father to Oden (his words were always italicized. It also kick-starts the story that will be resolved in the next in-game event - the finale of Oden, Lord of Hail.</p>
    <p>It doesn&rsquo;t take much guessing to see that Oden is distressed by his fate. Ever from the &ldquo;rebirth&rdquo; he underwent during his dream, the Lord has been keenly aware of his impending demise (<span class="tooltip">#83<span class="tooltiptext ref83"></span></span>, <span class="tooltip">#84<span class="tooltiptext ref84"></span></span>). Despite his old age, he is a living being - even in the world of Dark Souls it&rsquo;s natural to be afraid of perishing.</p>
    <p><span class="tooltip">#105<span class="tooltiptext ref105"></span></span> is a lot more puzzling. A straight continuation from <span class="tooltip">#104<span class="tooltiptext ref104"></span></span>, it talks about <i>something</i> staring at Oden. Wildly guessing, this could be Heart of Spears&rsquo; corpse. If we assume that after waking up, Oden had spent his time in the Father&rsquo;s workshop, he would certainly see the carcass. The peculiar part of the poem is the latter half - this <i>something</i> at some point possessed will, wise mind, and &ldquo;false vision&rdquo;. All of these could be vaguely related to Heart of Spears: being the first Spear of the Church it was likely a strong-willed warrior, and likely one of a decent mind. The &ldquo;false vision&rdquo; however is the most concrete relation we can build. As the first protector of Filianore, Heart of Spears was very likely in favor of the rule of the gods. And Oden was exactly against it, so it would make sense for him to refer to Heart of Spears&rsquo; vision as &ldquo;false&rdquo;. This is not a concrete theory, but in the same manner as a lot of Dark Souls lore, the Puppeteer has left the details of his story up for interpretation.</p>

    <p>Four days later, the next in-game event began. The one that would become the penultimate of the whole story, and the last time we see Oden, Lord of Hail.</p>
    <p>Early on during the day, the Puppeteer had sent us <span class="tooltip">#106<span class="tooltiptext ref106"></span></span> in his usual manner. The unrest we saw in <span class="tooltip">#104<span class="tooltiptext ref104"></span></span> was confirmed, as was the impending event. We met it with excitement and anticipation, hungry for some more in-game action.</p>
    <p>The Puppeteer did not disappoint. With <span class="tooltip">#107<span class="tooltiptext ref107"></span></span>, all PC players were alerted, and the hunt began. In the fashion similar to the final events of Nameless Flame and Heart of Spears, we have been ordered to butcher the puppet, and bring back the &ldquo;last fruit&rdquo; of its life.</p>
    <p>Under the lead storming skies of the Great Belfry, Oden awaited us. Most of Lord&rsquo;s tricks remained the same as during his first event. There were, however, a couple of changes. The first difference was a new spell in Lord&rsquo;s arsenal - an enormous Lightning Stake-like bolt that did no damage, but knocked down everyone around him. The second change - limits for the number of players in Lord&rsquo;s world were disabled right from the start, which meant that there could be up to 5 invaders fight Oden at the same time.</p>

        <div class="youtube" data-embed="N3OZEXdoQ1M"><div class="play-button"></div></div>
    </div>

    <p><span class="tooltip">#108<span class="tooltiptext ref108"></span></span> is yet another peculiar poem from Oden&rsquo;s point of view. The ancient lord is speaking not to us, nor to the Father, but to some other character - to his &ldquo;dear friend&rdquo; who, it seems, died a long time ago. This poem is very isolated from any other lore we have on Oden, which is exactly why it&rsquo;s puzzling in a way similar to <span class="tooltip">#105<span class="tooltiptext ref105"></span></span>.</p>
    <p>There were no significant changes in Oden&rsquo;s behavior throughout the event. As more and more people fought him, he began using his teleportation magic and leaving the glowing white orbs in places he would teleport to. Tikaro had gotten a detailed view on the orbs in the recording below:</p>

    <button class="collapsible"><i class="fas fa-film"></i>Tikaro vs. Lord of Hail<i class="fas fa-angle-double-down" style="float: right;"></i></button>
    <div class="collapsible_content">
        <div class="youtube" data-embed="d0XOZNVX-GI"><div class="play-button"></div></div>
    </div>

    <p>Oden directed his attention to the Father in <span class="tooltip">#109<span class="tooltiptext ref109"></span></span>. In contrast to the previous poem this one is straight-forward in meaning: despite Father&rsquo;s simple origin as a human being (which is exactly what a <i>wight</i> is), the elder Lord respects his sharp mind and skillful hands.</p>

    <button class="collapsible"><i class="fas fa-film"></i>Tikaro vs. Lord of Hail<i class="fas fa-angle-double-down" style="float: right;"></i></button>
    <div class="collapsible_content">
        <div class="youtube" data-embed="fF2T_m5Yeu0"><div class="play-button"></div></div>
    </div>

    <p>As the finale drew nigh, the doubts and fears plaguing Oden have been washed away. In <span class="tooltip">#110<span class="tooltiptext ref110"></span></span> he resolutely orders us to work with the Father ever on, as we are the &ldquo;last piece that oughtn&rsquo;t sway&rdquo;. Unbent, the puppet takes on the last set of invaders, and bids us all farewell. Next time we invade, Oden is stationary and docile. He sits at the highest peak of the Great Belfry, his hat removed, and a glowing soul in his arms.</p>

        <div class="youtube" data-embed="pUhuKBopkpw"><div class="play-button"></div></div>
    </div>

    <p>(Annotation 1: There is a peculiar detail about Oden&rsquo;s face. He was always referenced as having a &ldquo;clear eye&rdquo;. It was interpreted as him being able to understand and see things others did not. But as seen in his death pose, his right eye is quite literally glowing with bright blue. So perhaps the earlier mentions could have had a different meaning?)</p>
    <p>(Annotation 2: As you have probably realized yourself by now, Oden&rsquo;s character draws a lot of inspiration from the Norse god Odin. </p>
    <p>Odin is a god of wisdom, war, and poetry, and the chief god of aesir. He is usually depicted as one-eyed, long-bearded and wearing a broad hat. The one-eyed detail is important - Odin willingly sacrificed his eye to drink from Mimir&rsquo;s well and by doing so obtain great wisdom. Eyes and wisdom draw a parallel to Oden&rsquo;s &ldquo;clear eye&rdquo;, for which he was not forgiven and potentially exiled by the gods.</p>
    <p>Moreover, Odin wielded a magical spear Gungnir. If we assume that the &ldquo;titan Lord of Thunder&rdquo; who subdued Heart of Spears is Oden, Lord of Hail, then the &ldquo;accursed spear&rdquo; stuck through Heart&rsquo;s ribcage must be Oden&rsquo;s weapon.)</p>
    <p>The Father, observing the resolution of the event, reacts with <span class="tooltip">#111<span class="tooltiptext ref111"></span></span>. He is pleased with Oden&rsquo;s will overcoming his fears. And, which is more important, he now has everything he needs to set the final part of his plan into motion. In his own words - &ldquo;all pieces caught, left is the cord&rdquo;. With the Humanity, Heart&rsquo;s corpse, and now Oden&rsquo;s Lord Soul, what remains is for craftsman to use these precious resources.</p>

    <img src="assets/images/180422_oden_soul.png" data-action="zoom"/>

    <p>Along with <span class="tooltip">#111<span class="tooltiptext ref111"></span></span>, we have obtained the last &ldquo;item&rdquo; of the story - Oden&rsquo;s Lord Soul. Mimicking the pose Oden was sitting in during his &ldquo;death scene&rdquo;, the item is depicted not just as a soul like the Humanity, but as an open hand giving us the soul. And, despite it&rsquo;s bleak color and slightly warped appearance (likely referencing Oden&rsquo;s extreme age and decay), it still looks like the soul obtained from a Dark Souls boss.</p>
    <p>Soon after the end of the event, Jean received <span class="tooltip">#112<span class="tooltiptext ref112"></span></span>. It reinforced the fact that Oden is now gone, and nothing remains but the bright Lord Soul. The Father, likely reflecting more on the Puppeteer&rsquo;s sentiments (as in, the real-life author), comments on being pleased that his work was not in vain.</p>
    <p>With all of this said and done, no more puppets remain. The original four puppets are long gone. Nameless Flame broken and harvested for scraps of Humanity. Heart of Spears butchered until nothing but a soulless dead corpse remained. Oden, Lord of Hail gone, offering his soul born uncountable eons ago. The next time we would see the Puppeteer in-game would be during the final event of the whole story.</p>

    <h1 class="chapter-title">XV. &ldquo;...I am soon done?&rdquo;</h1>
    <p class="chapter-desc">April 28–May 10, 2018</p>

    <p>The Father was quick at work. Two days after Lord of Hail had perished, poem <span class="tooltip">#113<span class="tooltiptext ref113"></span></span> appeared in #builds - a channel of our discord server dedicated to discussions about build-making in the game. It, as well as several upcoming poems, will be formatted in a specific way: every second poem will have each line start with ellipses.</p>
    <p><span class="tooltip">#113<span class="tooltiptext ref113"></span></span> begins a series of poems dedicated to the Father&rsquo;s craft. Examining what is almost certainly the Heart of Spears&rsquo; corpse, it becomes apparent to him that the body will have to be reinforced before it&rsquo;s ready to be reanimated.</p>
    <p>This is where an interesting mind-game begins within our community. Apparently, in parallel with these poems sent in public, the puppeteer had began messaging several members of the community in private, and making them &ldquo;fetch&rdquo; him the armor pieces for the last puppet. Each was sent a lengthy poem telling them to keep the exchange a secret, and verbosely describing which armor piece had to be fetched.</p>
    <p>After poem <span class="tooltip">#113<span class="tooltiptext ref113"></span></span>, Narcolept was hit with the first fetching request, coming in as poem <span class="tooltip">#114<span class="tooltiptext ref114"></span></span>. The fetcher figured out that Dancer&rsquo;s Gauntlets were wanted, and was then summoned by &ldquo;The Father&rdquo; at the High Wall of Lothric.</p>

    <img src="assets/images/180428_narc_fetch.jpg" data-action="zoom"/>

    <p>From Fanboy&rsquo;s words (who was the next fetcher), they never saw The Father while being in his world, being left to drop the desired armor piece and disappear. Moreover, the fetchers never even knew if what they gave out was the right piece of armor - the poem was the only indication of the Puppeteer&rsquo;s desires.</p>
    <p>After the successful exchange, Narcolept left the world and received the following image from the Puppeteer:</p>

    <img src="assets/images/180428_puppet3.jpg" data-action="zoom"/>

    <p>Because the original is awfully dim, let us brighten it up artificially:</p>

    <img src="assets/images/180428_puppet3_lit.jpg" data-action="zoom"/>

    <p>Several points of interest tight from the start. First of all, this is inside the Father&rsquo;s workshop, which we first saw in <span class="tooltip">#101<span class="tooltiptext ref101"></span></span>. The figure in front of the fireplace is very likely the Heart&rsquo;s corpse which is being fixed and stitched by the Father. It&rsquo;s naked aside from the Dancer&rsquo;s Gauntlets, which Narcolept had just fetched. The corpse also has a greatly malformed chest. In-game it&rsquo;s completely hollowed out, but within the lens of the Puppeteer&rsquo;s story it&rsquo;s likely the damage from the spear Heart of Spears was impaled with.</p>
    <p>Lastly, the rim of the image is blurred, and there is a &ldquo;???&rdquo; in the bottom-right. Later on we would get more of these images, and then it would be realized that the question marks signified in-game location. The &ldquo;???&rdquo; likely means that the Father&rsquo;s workshop is in an unknown place.</p>
    <p>After successfully receiving the Gauntlets, the Puppeteer had signaled a success with poem <span class="tooltip">#115<span class="tooltiptext ref115"></span></span>. Done with the smallest piece of armor, the Father was set on moving to the legs of the corpse.</p>
    <p>But before the next fetching, poem <span class="tooltip">#116<span class="tooltiptext ref116"></span></span> appeared. We initially were uncertain what it was talking about. In hindsight, it&rsquo;s visible that it&rsquo;s a poem about the &ldquo;cyclopean spear&rdquo; by which the Heart of Spears was impaled. While working on the Heart&rsquo;s corpse, the Father surely had to take it out. And as we saw in the image Narcolept received for the first fetch, the Spear was indeed extracted.</p>
    <p>Why would the spear be important though? Well, the puppet in question would need a weapon. And in Father&rsquo;s own words, &ldquo;cross oh so old, you&rsquo;re fit to be the arm to end this tale of gore&rdquo;.</p>
    <p>(Annotation: The spear itself is quite important. We first see it stuck in the Heart of Spears. We know that the first Spear had a strong affinity for the gods - the Heart of Spears used lightning based miracles and was only seen in the Ringed City, protecting Filianore.</p>
    <p><span class="tooltip">#27<span class="tooltiptext ref27"></span></span>, <span class="tooltip">#31<span class="tooltiptext ref31"></span></span>, <span class="tooltip">#60<span class="tooltiptext ref60"></span></span>, <span class="tooltip">#98<span class="tooltiptext ref98"></span></span>, tell us that Oden, the &lsquo;titan Lord of Thunder&rsquo;, had struck Heart of Spears with the Spear, and thus has subdued it and plunged it into the Abyss. From DS1, we have Dark Ember&rsquo;s description:</p>

    <blockquote><p>Ember required for weapon ascension. The church long hid the forbidden black ember, and no living blacksmith knows of it.</p>
        <p>Occult weapons were used to hunt the gods, and are effective against their following and kin.</p>
        —Dark Ember, DS1</blockquote>

    <p>The fact that Heart of Spears—a powerful follower of gods—was plunged into the abyssal slumber after being struck with this spear indicated that it must have indeed been a potent occult artifact back in the days. And now the Father aims to give this weapon to his last puppet to kill the Soul of Cinders—the very manifestation of the gods&rsquo; ambitions.)</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Two days later, on May 1, poem <span class="tooltip">#117<span class="tooltiptext ref117"></span></span> announced the second fetching. We, of course, were unaware of it, and even each of the fetchers themselves did not know whether there were any others. As per the Puppeteer&rsquo;s request, until the end of the event they would have to dance around the truth.</p>
    <p><span class="tooltip">#117<span class="tooltiptext ref117"></span></span> itself again talked about the poor state of the Heart&rsquo;s corpse—it sustained so much damage that it couldn&rsquo;t even move in any meaningful way. After mending of the internal damage was done, more armor was needed. Here the Puppeteer pulled a curious move: this very poem had asked us to choose the armor for the puppet (&ldquo;encase by hand in leather, stone, or metal rich?&rdquo;). A quick response from those online at the moment was unanimous: &ldquo;metal is the coolest&rdquo;.</p>
    <p>And so, the second fetching truly began. This time, Fanboy was the fetcher. <span class="tooltip">#118<span class="tooltiptext ref118"></span></span>, written in the same style as Narcolept&rsquo;s <span class="tooltip">#114<span class="tooltiptext ref114"></span></span>, it asked of Fanboy to bring the Dancer&rsquo;s Leggings to the High Wall of Lothric. And just in the same way as Narcolept, the current fetcher had been summoned into &ldquo;The Father&rdquo;&rsquo;s world and dropped the armor piece without ever seeing the Father.</p>
    <p>The image was yet again the reward for successfully solving this little riddle.</p>

    <img src="assets/images/180428_puppet0.jpg" data-action="zoom"/>
    <img src="assets/images/180428_puppet0_lit.jpg" data-action="zoom"/>

    <p>The original almost completely black, some brightening is in order if we&rsquo;re to see anything. Heart&rsquo;s corpse is laying in the same pose as in the Narcolept&rsquo;s reward image, yet this time away from the fireplace and on a table. The head is again completely invisible, but we now see that both the Dancer&rsquo;s Gauntlets and Leggings are equipped firmly. The location of the image is still unknown (&ldquo;???&rdquo;).</p>
    <p>After the successful exchange with Fanboy, the Puppeteer had announced the progress in the puppet&rsquo;s construction with <span class="tooltip">#119<span class="tooltiptext ref119"></span></span>. The limbs were now completely mended, and the Father was undoubtedly pleased. Now came the time to fix the torso. It appears that the corpse, while not being alive by any means, was not necessarily dead. The last line signifies that it may be in something like a mindless hollowed out state. It&rsquo;s nevertheless slightly confusing, as we know that the corpses heart was most certainly torn out by the Spear (<span class="tooltip">#30<span class="tooltiptext ref30"></span></span>).</p>
    <p>On May 2, a small discussion arose about the fact that the Puppeteer had asked us which armor to use. Some people decided that &ldquo;metal&rdquo; wasn&rsquo;t the best choice, but the Puppeteer had struck them down with <span class="tooltip">#120<span class="tooltiptext ref120"></span></span>. Aside fro shutting down the argument, it let us know what exactly the Father is doing—preparing the Heart&rsquo;s corpse for the last part of his grand plan.</p>
    <p>On May 3, the work on the torso began. <span class="tooltip">#121<span class="tooltiptext ref121"></span></span> let us know that the Father didn&rsquo;t think the Dragonscale Armor—which was the armor Heart of Spears wore—befitting the last puppet. Craftsman pondered about using the &ldquo;old rusted plate&rdquo;, but ultimately decides that it also doesn&rsquo;t fit the great fate he had planned for the puppet.</p>
    <p>And so, he comes to the third fetcher, Kallah, with poem <span class="tooltip">#122<span class="tooltiptext ref122"></span></span>. The chestpiece chosen was from the Firelink set. Fitting that the thing made to kill the Soul of Cinders wears its armor, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
    <p>As with the other fetchers, upon successfully giving the Father what he wanted, Kallah had received an image:</p>

    <img src="assets/images/180428_puppet1.jpg" data-action="zoom"/>
    <img src="assets/images/180428_puppet1_lit.jpg" data-action="zoom"/>

    <p>The corpse is now almost completely ready for its big appearance. <span class="tooltip">#123<span class="tooltiptext ref123"></span></span> made everyone know that the puppet&rsquo;s torso was mended and safely encased in the warm metal of the chestplate.</p>
    <p>The Father, in a sudden realization, understands that very soon he will be free of his own plan. Perhaps this is the Puppeteer again telling us his own thoughts through his in-story character. His &ldquo;journey&rdquo; with us was indeed long, spanning a third of a year in our community. He, certainly, was glad to see this big story safely coming to a satisfying conclusion.</p>
    <p>The last fetch was to be done on May 5. <span class="tooltip">#124<span class="tooltiptext ref124"></span></span> yet again signified the Father working on the puppet—this time on its head.</p>
    <p>However, before that, <span class="tooltip">#126<span class="tooltiptext ref126"></span></span> was sent, addressing SlugBot. SlugBot was our server&rsquo;s main and only bot, developed and handled by Narcolept. Not so long ago, the bot began hosting mini-boss events similar in idea to the Puppeteer&rsquo;s story, but featuring its own original mini-bosses. This poem was the Puppeteer&rsquo;s response to those events. Some people thought that it was an attack on the other person doing mini-bosses and stealing the Puppeteer&rsquo;s scene. However, Alex&rsquo;s interpretation, which most agreed with, was much friendlier and more peaceful:</p>
    <blockquote>I&rsquo;m taking it like this [line by line]
        <br>- Someone else is creating their own story?
        <br>- Next line is weird grammatically, but it seems like he&rsquo;s saying that, with pleasure (because he&rsquo;s glad to see someone else doing the same thing he is), he he holds his own tired gaze with the other person. Looking at someone directly in the eye is usually a form of acknowledging or recognizing them.
        <br>- Next line is telling us that his own gaze is the one of someone who&rsquo;s &ldquo;meek, exhausted, pale.&rdquo; I presume that&rsquo;s because he himself is tired as this whole thing has been a lot of work for him.
        <br>- Last line is basically telling the other person that he hopes that they&rsquo;re able to get through their story despite the challenges of doing so.</blockquote>
    <p>Going back to <span class="tooltip">#124<span class="tooltiptext ref124"></span></span>, a discussion had sprung up about this potentially being another choice we had to make. All of the &ldquo;crowns&rdquo; were recalled quickly. Most literal &ldquo;crowns&rdquo; were quickly abandoned. Firelink helmet and Lorian&rsquo;s Crown were proposed as good possibilities - both fit the description of &ldquo;tough metal&rdquo;. </p>
    <p>Having exhausted the basic helmets we also thought that Cheat Engine may be involved, with the Puppeteer doing something like putting Undead Arena&rsquo;s crown on top of this puppet&rsquo;s head.</p>
    <p>The reality was much simpler. The fourth—and last—fetcher was chosen to be Jean. He received <span class="tooltip">#125<span class="tooltiptext ref125"></span></span>, which asked him to drop Lothric&rsquo;s Helmet in the Dragon Barracks. Of course, he was unaware of any of the other fetchers or anything that was happening &ldquo;under the hood&rdquo; for the past week, just as all of them were.</p>

    <p>With the request done, Jean got his confirmation and reward:</p>

    <img src="assets/images/180428_puppet2.jpg" data-action="zoom"/>
    <img src="assets/images/180428_puppet2_lit.jpg" data-action="zoom"/>

    <p>This image was later shared by Jean with us, omitting any information about the fetching he did, and making the image quality a lot worse (likely intentional).</p>

    <img src="assets/images/180428_puppetGarbage.jpg" data-action="zoom"/>

    <p>We, having not seen a single image since <span class="tooltip">#101<span class="tooltiptext ref101"></span></span>, were extremely excited by this. The resolution was just good enough to get the general idea of what we were seeing, but not as good as the original to catch any details. Well done on Jean&rsquo;s part in preserving the mystery.</p>
    <p>Everyone was quick to jump on the image and try to extract as much as we possibly could. Immediately we knew this was the puppet in the making. The helmet was correctly identified as Lothric Knight&rsquo;s, but slightly uncertain. The leggings were easier - the pointy sabatons were quickly recognized as Dancer&rsquo;s. </p>
    <p>As this discussion was going on, the Puppeteer sent his fetchers a simple &ldquo;!&rdquo;, likely alarming them to not spill the secret. (As of writing this it&rsquo;s unknown whether all 4 have gotten an exclamation mark message. Only Fanboy and Narcolept have openly said that they did, and both were present during the armor discussion).</p>
    <p>The chestpiece and gauntlets, however, were harder. Gauntlets Narcolept correctly said were Dancer&rsquo;s. But, alarmed by the Puppeteer, quickly threw that idea under the bus in favor of Fire Witch&rsquo;s. The chestpiece was thought to be either Firelink or Yhorm&rsquo;s (which can be equipped in the game via Cheat Engine).</p>
    <p>Later on, Noxuary would go in-game and use CE to check both possibilities for the chestpiece. He produced two screenshots, and upon looking at them we have unanimously decided that the figure on Jean&rsquo;s image was most certainly wearing Firelink chest:</p>

    <img src="assets/images/180428_puppetArmorTest0.jpg" data-action="zoom"/>
    <img src="assets/images/180428_puppetArmorTest1.jpg" data-action="zoom"/>

    <p>Around this point an idea arose that Oden&rsquo;s soul should be put into the Heart&rsquo;s vessel image in the same manner Ragg did with the Humanity. With a little bit of work, Tikaro did just that:</p>
    <img src="assets/images/180428_full_vessel_tik.png" data-action="zoom"/>

    <p>Immediately, the Puppeteer responded with his own version of the image:</p>
    <img src="assets/images/180428_full_vessel.png" data-action="zoom"/>

    <p>This image was never used for anything in the story, but it did confirm the idea that the last puppet would be created exactly in the same way: by putting the Lord Soul and Humanity into the Heart&rsquo;s corpse.</p>
    <p>Poem <span class="tooltip">#127<span class="tooltiptext ref127"></span></span> was sent at some point after the last fetch was done. Just as the the previous poems which finished a fetching quest, this one had set a goal for the future. Only, this time it was a goal the Father would achieve alone: &ldquo;One task remains &lsquo;fore I can kneel: breathe life into the finished mold&rdquo;. Mended from the damage, encased in fresh, robust armor—Heart&rsquo;s corpse was ready to be reanimated.</p>
    <p>And the Puppeteer was ready for his final event. He contacted Narcolept (who was a fellow moderator of our server) and broke his character to make a proper announcement of the final event:
    <blockquote>@PC Player
        <br>The Puppeteer has also been working hard. The wet whispers speak of something big happening next weekend (11/05/18 - 13/05/18), starting at 16:00 GMT each day...</blockquote>
    <p>We of course understood what this meant. Three consecutive days of events announced as clearly as possible, the father finishing up the new puppet, and nothing left in the Timeline? We were going full speed towards the bug finale. We were somewhat sentimental about it, but were looking forward to the possibility of talking with the person behind the Puppeteer.</p>
    <p>Two days later, as described by <span class="tooltip">#128<span class="tooltiptext ref128"></span></span>, the Father imbued the precious corpse with a &ldquo;formless grey&rdquo; mixture of Humanity and the Lord Soul. And it was the last time he would do it. After this poem, sent on May 7, we would be getting one every day up until the final event.</p>
    <p>On May 8, the result of Father&rsquo;s meticulous craft was shown. <span class="tooltip">#129<span class="tooltiptext ref129"></span></span>. Born of both the dark and the light, the puppet was neither (&ldquo;Beyond the scope of light, beyond the reach of dark&rdquo;). The synthetic life outside the scope of the world, helplessly caught inside the endless loop of Ages.</p>

    <img src="assets/images/180428_puppet4.jpg" data-action="zoom"/>
    <img src="assets/images/180428_puppet4_lit.jpg" data-action="zoom"/>

    <p>The Father&rsquo;s work was done. Yet this life needed instructions—and they were given in <span class="tooltip">#130<span class="tooltiptext ref130"></span></span>. Yet again we saw the craftsman&rsquo;s unbent belief in his creation. And deservedly so—this creature was the result of his whole plan.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>On May 10, the day before the event, <span class="tooltip">#131<span class="tooltiptext ref131"></span></span> gave us the last bite of the creation of the puppet. The Great Old Sin (Soul of Cinders) is born of eons upon eons of Lords of Cinders sacrificing themselves to the First Flame. If Father&rsquo;s puppet was to succeed in wiping it out—it will have to grow much stronger, preying and <b>consuming</b> every last scrap of power it will find in any living being during its arduous journey.</p>
    <p>Now, we stood on the very culmination of not just the Father&rsquo;s plan, but of the whole story itself. Everything from the very beginning was building up to this. All the events and storylines we have experienced lead us to this one final event:</p>
</div>


<div class="space-between-chapters"></div>


<div id="c180511">
    <h1 class="chapter-title">XVI. The Journey I</h1>
    <p class="chapter-desc">May 11–12, 2018
        <br>The Puppet</p>

    <p>The Puppeteer was punctual. Friday the 11 of May, the event was to begin at 4PM GMT. An hour earlier, the Puppeteer had begun the countdown, reminding us of the impending culmination with numbers such as &ldquo;60&rdquo;, &ldquo;50&rdquo;, &ldquo;40&rdquo;. Most, of course, were already seeping with excitement and anticipation, and the countdown only fanned the flames.</p>
    <p>As the clock struck 3:50PM, <span class="tooltip">#132<span class="tooltiptext ref132"></span></span> revealed the name of the last marionette: <i>the Puppet</i>. As simple as could be, yet a fitting complement to <i>the Puppeteer</i>.</p>
    <p>The Father did all he could, the rest of the story lay in the Puppet&rsquo;s cold hands&mdash;and in ours. With the sole purpose of overpowering the tyrannic Sin, it has set out the long and arduous journey.</p>
    <p>At last, the countdown hit zero. The event has begun. And with it we were sent a peculiar link: &ldquo;https://www.twitch.tv/puppeteermusicbox&rdquo;. A stream? That couldn&rsquo;t be it, could it? No, it wasn&rsquo;t a stream, but rather an augmentation for the event. It was a &ldquo;music box&rdquo;, which would begin to play music during critical parts of the event. But not only that&mdash;the Puppeteer has prepared several dozens of wallpaper-like images to show throughout the event which would give us current status of the Puppet&rsquo;s journey. Avoiding premature spoilers, the original uncompressed album from the Puppeteer himself will be linked at the very end of this story. For now, we will include images as they become relevant.</p>
    <p>The very first image, which would become a &ldquo;stand-by&rdquo; as things were being set up, was this:</p>

    <img src="assets/images/180511_logo.jpg" data-action="zoom"/>

    <p>On its blurred background we can vaguely see the Puppet itself, lighting a bonfire.</p>
    <p>Shocked by the twitch link and not yet knowing what it would be for, we weren&rsquo;t expecting yet another thing. The event was not merely invasions or a red sign summoning like any of the ones we&rsquo;ve seen before. Instead&mdash;a Dried Finger run.</p>

    <img src="assets/images/180511_twitch0.jpg" data-action="zoom"/>

    <p>The preparations were deemed complete, and the event began. Twitch stream changed from the logo an image of the Puppet, rising up from the ground with naught but an old, broken sword in its hands.</p>
    <p>In tandem with the image, <span class="tooltip">#133<span class="tooltiptext ref133"></span></span> told of the Puppet unsteadily finding its way through the High Wall. The Father, despite no longer being involved with his creation, left some weaponry near the beginning of its journey for it &ldquo;to find and use as told&rdquo;. Why not give them to it from the beginning? Perhaps so it receives them after becoming more proficient at movement&mdash;its synthetic birth happened mere days ago, after all.</p>

    <p>Out of our eager Red Eye Orb-cracking mass, Fanboy was the very first one to encounter the Puppet. </p>

    </div>

    <p>The thing was found at the very beginning of the High Wall, in the small room with the vessel. As became apparent, the Puppet was very much unlike any other ones we have faced before. Its health pool was stunningly huge&mdash;two or three times that of Lord of Hail (estimated at at least 2,000). But it came with a counter-balance - the Puppet neither healed nor accepted any healing items dropped by us.</p>

    <p>Caught by a clutch swing, Fanboy fell just short of killing the Puppet. Simultaneously, the Puppeteer sent us a message:
    <p class="killcount">&mdash;1&mdash;</p>
    <p>Kill count for the event. As more and more of us were butchered, we would begin speculating&mdash;was the Puppet growing stronger, feeding on our souls?</p>

    <p>In the first few battles we realized that its broken straight sword wasn&rsquo;t completely normal. It had the moveset and the damage of the regular one, but its weapon art had an unprecedented amounts of poise&mdash;even allowing for trades with heavy weapons.</p>

    <p>Along with the rubbish blade, the Puppet was heavily reliant on regular, rustic consumables: firebombs, undead hunter charms, and throwing knives. The charms in particular were used aggressively, especially during the times the Puppet&rsquo;s opponents were retreating and healing. The synthetic thing was unlike the Father&rsquo;s previous marionettes&mdash;it was not merciful in its advances, seeking just to kill any immediate opponent with its under-powered arsenal.</p>
    <p>(Some of our recorders, Fanboy in particular, decided to throw some music over their videos. Enjoy)</p>

    </div>

    <p>Despite our best efforts to stagnate it, the Puppet has made its way throw the High Wall, down to its boss, Vordt. Here, we have glimpsed the first critical point of the event.</p>

    <p><span class="tooltip">#134<span class="tooltiptext ref134"></span></span> clearly instructed us to put red signs by the boss fog. The Puppet (with kill count currently at 6) was thirsting for our souls more and more. And to sate it, it would wait for us at the end of each areas, as nothing short of a <b>boss</b>.</p>

    <img src="assets/images/180511_twitch1.jpg" data-action="zoom"/>

    <p>As we inscribed our red signs, one by one we were pulled into the Puppet&rsquo;s world. Via a backstab teleport, it would transport us to its boss arena: the open area behind the High Wall&rsquo;s gates. And, every time one of us would challenge the Puppet, the Music Box would begin playing this area&rsquo;s boss theme. (The full list was also provided by the Puppeteer after the event, it will be linked along with the album of Twitch graphics.)</p>

    <p>(Annotation: each boss fight which was recorded will include a version with the Puppeter&rsquo;s authentic boss music overlaid on top of the footage.

    <p>In Vordt&rsquo;s chamber, or somewhere near it, the Puppet had found first of the two gifts the Father had left (<span class="tooltip">#132<span class="tooltiptext ref132"></span></span>). As some of us have realized quickly&mdash;and as confirmed in <span class="tooltip">#135<span class="tooltiptext ref135"></span></span> &mdash;the gift was the Drakeblood Greatsword, previously wielded by none other than Oden, Lord of Hail. Faithful to the &ldquo;stormborn&rdquo; description, it had Storm Ruler&rsquo;s effects on its stance.</p>

    </div>

    <p>More curiously, the latter half of the poem hints at the Puppet already knowing this weapon. The artificial thing was born of two opposite souls merged and stitched into the Heart of Spear&rsquo;s corpse. One possible explanation would be that the Puppet&rsquo;s eyes were those of the Heart, which many eons ago was subdued by Oden, titan Lord of Thunder.</p>

    <p>As most of us challenged the Puppet (and Jean fell off a cliff during his attempt), the Puppeteer responded to some technical difficulties with the following image (likely referring to not seeing any more red signs?)</p>

    <img src="assets/images/180511_additional0.png" data-action="zoom"/>

    <p>Shortly afterward, message saying &ldquo;1 LEFT&rdquo; let us know that the boss fight was nearing the conclusion. After Fanboy was defeated, the High Wall was completed. <span class="tooltip">#136<span class="tooltiptext ref136"></span></span> let us know that the thing&rsquo;s thirst was temporarily quenched, and it was to press on on its journey, invigorated and stronger than before.</p>



    <p class="killcount">&mdash;11&mdash;</p>



    <p>The Puppet ventured on through the putrid settlement, Oden&rsquo;s stormborn greatsword completely replacing the broken straight sword. It was now obviously growing stronger, consuming a Fading Soul consumable each time it killed one of us. With some degree of excitement a couple of people thought about just how powerful it would become by the end of the event.</p>
    <img src="assets/images/180511_twitch2.jpg" data-action="zoom"/>
    <p>Curiously enough, as per Fanboy&rsquo;s record of the event (to whom many thanks go, as he diligently kept updated during this whole finale), the Puppet&rsquo;s firebombs began to combine the effects of Black Firebombs and Lighting Urns. There&rsquo;s no footage of it, so this is possible but not confirmed. Also, it had obtained a weak regeneration effect, seen as the golden glow around its torso (perhaps a regen effect from a talisman?)</p>

    <button class="collapsible"><i class="fas fa-film"></i>Narcolept vs. The Puppet by the great pyre and on the bridge<i class="fas fa-angle-double-down" style="float: right;"></i></button>

    </div>

    <p>As the thing reached the bonfire on the dilapidated bridge, the Father shared with us the details of the second gift he left for his precious marionette. <span class="tooltip">#137<span class="tooltiptext ref137"></span></span> spoke of the &ldquo;cross&rdquo; with which the Cursed Greatwood&rsquo;s bark was stricken. There could of course only be one thing fitting the description of a &ldquo;cross&rdquo; which the &ldquo;heart mended&rdquo; surely would remember. The very occult spear which had stricken Heart of Spears centuries ago&mdash;now, fit to be the weapon of the Hearts corpse. In death, on its journey to butcher the manifestation of the gods it followed in life.</p>

    <p>As the Puppet was nearing the Greatwood, two invaders could get in its world at once. This was usually not in favor of the synthetic thing, but it persevered, as it inevitably had to.</p>

    <p>Its kills amounting to 17, <span class="tooltip">#138<span class="tooltiptext ref138"></span></span> let us know that the next boss fight was incoming. The Puppet had found the occult spear, the heart beating within its ribcage surely having some sort of a recollection of the weapon. Now, it was ready to test it on us.</p>

    <img src="assets/images/180511_twitch3.jpg" data-action="zoom"/>

    </div>

    <p>To the wails of the music right from Dark Souls III&rsquo;s unused content, we were to challenge the soul-hungry Puppet once more. As confirmed by this boss&rsquo; twitch image, it indeed obtained Arstor&rsquo;s Spear, previously stuck in Heart of Spears&rsquo; chest.</p>

    <p>The spear, heavily modified, was equipped with two custom weapon arts: Neck Swipe characteristic of schythes, and Spin Slash like that of the Partizan. The Neck Swipe in particular did horrifying amounts of damage, erasing close to half a health bar if it landed.</p>

    <p>Sitting in the voice chat during the event, both Narcolept and Fanboy have began speculating that the Puppet&rsquo;s animations may have been tweaked ever so slightly. The speed at which the thing could close the distance between it and its opponent was intimidatingly unnatural.</p>

    <p>Yet another detail which Narcolept has remarked was that the Puppet was completely mute. Upon dying, a normal character produces some sort of a scream. The synthetic thing, however, just fell to the floor in complete silence&mdash;certainly adding to the atmosphere.</p>

    <p>Some of us challenged the Puppet successfully, some not so much&mdash;but the time for this boss fight was coming to an end. With <span class="tooltip">#139<span class="tooltiptext ref139"></span></span>, just one more person could try their luck and skills.</p>

    <p>In the very same poem, Father began wondering&mdash;now just witness to his creation&rsquo;s journey&mdash;what could it possibly be thinking? An amalgamation of numerous beings broken, stitched, torn apart and purified in grotesque ways&mdash;all for a single goal with a solemn fate afterwards. Yet it was living, breathing. And now, on its journey, it saw nothing but endless waves of foes rising up against it, only to fall and feed it more and more scraps of their souls. Truly, a &ldquo;bloodbath&rdquo;.</p>



    <p class="killcount">&mdash;26&mdash;</p>



    <p>The woods were passed quickly, both because the area did not offer much room and could only be invaded past the Halfway Fortress bonfire. Nevertheless, we have gotten poem <span class="tooltip">#140<span class="tooltiptext ref140"></span></span> while the Pupppet was fighting through the interminable waves of invaders amidst the trees. </p>

    <p>The poem gave a glimpse at just how strong the Great Old Sin (Soul of Cinders) was supposed to be within the Puppeteer&rsquo;s story: having obtained proper arms, it was already a deadly opponent. Yet to the Sin, it was a mere &ldquo;bug&rdquo;.</p>
    <p>Moreover, <span class="tooltip">#140<span class="tooltiptext ref140"></span></span> gave us a glimpse at the upgrade the artificial thing would soon be receiving. Up until this point, the Puppet has been unable to heal itself aside from small passive regen. However it was generally only a matter of time before it succumbed to the damage we would gradually deal. It had to obtain some way of healing. This way would be precisely the &ldquo;cruel brother to estus mug&rdquo;.</p>
    <p>The Puppet consumed more and more of our souls and, presumably, souls of every living enemy and boss it would com across in-game. As its headcount went up to 29, and we were done clearing the area out, <span class="tooltip">#141<span class="tooltiptext ref141"></span></span> set us up for the next boss fight.</p>

    <p>The Puppet did not gain any new weaponry, as during the previous encounters. The souls it consumed, however &ldquo;congested&rdquo; as per <span class="tooltip">#141<span class="tooltiptext ref141"></span></span> into the golden consumable soul it could now use. Upon consuming it, the mute synthetic knight would burst up with potent regen not unlike the Lifegems of Dark Souls II. Invaders frequently play a war of attrition with their targets. With this addition to its arsenal, the Puppet could withstand drawn-out conflicts.</p>
    <p>Sometimes, the artificial thing would welcome its challengers already damaged, showing what its Soul can do even before starting the fight. An sidenote observation: the Puppet never used the regen soul more than once during the encounter.</p>

    <p><span class="tooltip">#142<span class="tooltiptext ref142"></span></span> forced us&mdash;and our unyielding target&mdash;to keep going forward, abandoning Crucifixion Woods. The last challenger was fought, the Puppet&rsquo;s kill count set to 34. Abiding by Father&rsquo;s word from the poem, its tireless pursuit of might would continue on, until at last it was string enough to challenge the Sin itself.</p>
    <p>That is&mdash;after a 30-minute break, announced by <span class="tooltip">#143<span class="tooltiptext ref143"></span></span>. The Dried Finger run has been going on for four straight hours with no time to breathe. Certainly, the Puppeteer would want his public and himself be able to have a small breather.</p>



    <p class="killcount">&mdash;34&mdash;</p>



    <p>Having slain the Crystal Sage and challenged us&mdash;invaders&mdash;to offer our souls to it in bloody combat, the Puppet had decided to tackle the Cathedral before venturing into the Farron Keep.</p>

    <p>Under the crimson skies, <span class="tooltip">#144<span class="tooltiptext ref144"></span></span> told us of a peculiar entity hanging in the air. Somewhere around the myriad graves heaped next to the Cathedral, a mirage of the &ldquo;lone blackened spirit&rdquo; stood. Upon reaching this place, the synthetic knight obtained two new items: the Dark Sword and the Dark Hand&mdash;a precursor to what would become one of the main themes of the event.</p>

    </div>

    <p>The Puppet sought the blackened spirit, hunted it, as told in <span class="tooltip">#145<span class="tooltiptext ref145"></span></span>. In so doing, the transient apparition grew stronger, awakening within mute knight&rsquo;s amalgamation of a soul some distant, vague recollections. Recollections of a sole survivor of a legion washed away by the eons, forgotten like an old nightmare. Somewhere within the Puppet&rsquo;s synthetic shell, <i>Lone Darkwraith</i> dwelt. Or, at least, some vague semblance of the puppet tied to the Cathedral of the Deep. It manifested itself as the Dark weaponry the Puppet had been using, but in nothing more.</p>

    </div>

    <p>We ventured deeper into the deep-stained cathedral, chasing after the mute knight now overcome with distant recollections. Marching on and consuming all the still-living residents of the cathedral, it succeeded in opening both of the shortcuts and, ultimately, coming to the Deacons of the Deep.</p>

    <p>There, our last change to see the Puppet, before the Darkwraith&rsquo;s colorul apparition completely overcame the blank void canvas that was the Puppet. <span class="tooltip">#146<span class="tooltiptext ref146"></span></span> alarmed us of precisely that happening. Having successfully consumed the Deacons, the thing gave in to the memories growing ever stronger. And in quick sparkling of the next boss encounter, we would be able to challenge the image of the Lone Darkwraith in its full glory.</p>

    </div>

    <p>Darkwraith&rsquo;s apparition was in full force, equipped with its own arsenal: Dark weaponry we saw before, as well as Ringed Knight Sword and Spear. Moreover, the fight took place not in the usual arena of the Deacons, but rather on top of Aldrich&rsquo;s sarcophagus - a fairly narrow and flat arena.</p>

    <p>The challengers were met with the Dark Sword paired with the Arstor&rsquo;s Spear, which were only later on changed into the ringed knight gear. The Puppet had also began restraining itself in attacking people when they were in need of healing&mdash;probably because it was able to inflict heavy damage quickly, and the Puppeteer had thought it would not be fun for the participants if he kept playing non-stop aggression.</p>
    <p>A lot of us challenged the Puppet&rsquo;s Darkwraith image here, with the Pupppet overcoming many, and consuming ever more souls. At last, with the count of its fallen foes reaching 48, Lone Darkwraith&rsquo;s recollections began to fade. Poem <span class="tooltip">#147<span class="tooltiptext ref147"></span></span> made it clear&mdash;the apparition left the Puppet&rsquo;s mind a black void just as it was before entering the Cathedral. A void slowly filling with uncontrollable hunger, as the knight engulfed more and more powerful beings.</p>



    <p class="killcount">&mdash;48&mdash;</p>



    <p>Forced by the all-encompassing desire, the Puppet grabbed the Small Doll from the Deacons&rsquo; corpses and returned to Crucifixion Woods, ready to take on the gigantic putrid swamp in which lay the ruins of the Farron Keep.</p>
    <img src="assets/images/180511_twitch9.jpg" data-action="zoom"/>
    <p>Yet after the Cathedral, seldom would the mute knight be without a mirage guide on its way. The Farron Keep invoked another fuzzy recollection of a blood-crazed pyromancer, having had no teacher but the nature itself. The man, as per Father&rsquo;s words in <span class="tooltip">#148<span class="tooltiptext ref148"></span></span>, had attacked the old man in horror, likely before succumbing to his strings and becoming a puppet himself.</p>

    <p>Redflame Erik&rsquo;s unstable shadow lay over the Puppet, manifesting itself in the off-hand Demon&rsquo;s Scar coupled with Flame Fan pyromancy.</p>

    <button class="collapsible"><i class="fas fa-film"></i>Qy vs. The Puppet getting dirty down in the swamp<i class="fas fa-angle-double-down" style="float: right;"></i></button>

    </div>

    <p>One by one, the three flames guarding the Abyss Watchers were snuffed out. The Puppet, apparently apathetic to status effects, went through the swamp in great haste, without using moss clumps whatsoever.</p>

    <img src="assets/images/180511_twitch10.jpg" data-action="zoom"/>

    <p>Upon reaching the Keep perimeter bonfire, the knight stalled, giving all of the remaining invaders a chance to fight it. After making up for the quickness of its journey through the deepest parts of the swamp, it pressed on.</p>

    <button class="collapsible"><i class="fas fa-film"></i>Fanboy vs. The Puppet up by the mausoleum<i class="fas fa-angle-double-down" style="float: right;"></i></button>

    </div>

    <p>Just as Darkwraith&rsquo;s memory was growing ever more potent whilst its host traversed the Cathedral, Redflame Erik&rsquo;s influence was becoming stronger, working its ways through the Puppet. <span class="tooltip">#149<span class="tooltiptext ref149"></span></span>, however, gave us a glimpse at what was truly happening within the mute shell we were chasing. The Puppet was overcome with mirages of marionettes previously residing in these areas. But, perhaps in a way similar to how it devoured souls, perhaps in an entirely different manner&mdash;it was devouring the images, feasting upon their experience and residual force. </p>
    <p>Redflame Erik&rsquo;s apparition, before the synthetic knight consumed it completely, was eager to challenge all of us who were still around. Thus, the area&rsquo;s boss fight began.</p>

    <img src="assets/images/180511_twitch11.jpg" data-action="zoom"/>

    </div>

    <p>Set to yet another track by Alex Roe (whose music would dominate the event, it seems the Puppeteer was quite fond of it), Redflame Erik&rsquo;s recollection waited for us. The fights began with the Puppet hitting us at full-force with a Chaos Flamberge and a Chaos Hand Axe - default weapons favored by the insane pyromancer. </p>

    </div>

    <p>Advancing deeper into the fight, the flamberge would be changed to the Demon&rsquo;s Scar, which moved from a mere off-hand to a main-hand weapon. The Puppet was extremely aggressive during the entire fight, with the constant pressure added from Fire Surge and Profaned Flame in tandem with everything already in its arsenal. If this was not enough, Dragonhead Shield would be brought up.</p>

    <button class="collapsible"><i class="fas fa-film"></i>Fanboy vs. Redflame Erik&rsquo;s apparition<i class="fas fa-angle-double-down" style="float: right;"></i></button>

    </div>

    <p>We have persevered through Erik&rsquo;s challenge. As its apparition was consumed by the Puppet, it sought after its next prey—the Abyss Watchers. After <span class="tooltip">#150<span class="tooltiptext ref150"></span></span> was sent, Fanboy successfully finished Erik&rsquo;s apparition off.</p>
    <p>The Abyss Watchers were a very important target for the Puppet. They were already once sacrificed to the First Flame, and, by extension, were a part of the Great Old Sin. The artificial knight was growing ever stronger in is journey,as we fell 55 times in total. Yet, just our Unkindled souls would not suffice if it were to overthrow the Sin. No, the thing would need to consume those much more powerful&mdash;the Lords of Cinder.</p>
    <p>(Annotation: after going through the Puppeteer&rsquo;s twitch graphics album, it appears that there were two alternative images for this area, which were never used during the event. The first was likely to be used upon reaching the Keep Perimeter bonfire, while the other one mimicks the Abyss Watcher&rsquo;s cutscene for the boss encounter. Both can be seen below.)</p>

    <p class="killcount">&mdash;55&mdash;</p>



    <p>A feast was to be held. The Watchers, evidently, fell, and their soul lay barren in front of the Puppet. <span class="tooltip">#151<span class="tooltiptext ref151"></span></span> tells us all we need to know. In some grotesque way that is never spoken of in details, the synthetic knight has devoured the sublime soul. And with it—a taste of what Great Old Sin possessed. (And a little detail: all of the poems sent in the Catacombs would be bold. This will become a trend for all the areas immediately succeeding the Puppet devouring a Lord of Cinders).</p>
    <img src="assets/images/180511_twitch12.jpg" data-action="zoom"/>
    <p>With each and every soul the mute puppet has consumed, it grew ever slightly stronger. But the soul of a Lord would not be equal to the soul of a mere Unkindled or less. While it would be traversing the decrepit Catacombs, it would find the soul engulfing its arms outside just as it was scorching its mind inside.</p>

    <p>Its right hand weapon now gained a special fire effect, different from the regular Charcoal Resin. Moreover, its Spear now gained a yet another weapon art - the Mad King&rsquo;s Folly. And ever still, the Puppet could now use more than one Golden Soul to regenerate its health. It&rsquo;s presumed, but not confirmed, that it could use no more than two souls now.</p>

    </div>

    <p>Emboldened by the &ldquo;blazing thunder&rdquo; of the Lord of Cinder&rsquo;s soul, the Puppet could now be invaded by as many as four people at once! No doubt it would prove to be a challenge for both the participants and the Puppeteer himself. Especially for the Puppeteer: as he would later confirm to be based in Europe, it was certainly past midnight, with the event spanning more than 8 consecutive hours with just one break.</p>

    <p>It was also discovered that the Puppet was not a fan of fighting near ledges:</p>

    </div>

    <p>But ever still, the mute knight kept fighting, and despite many of us standing in its way, it kept moving. Through the upper Catacombs, past the dangerous stairway guarded by the skeleton ball. Eventually, it made its way to the bonfire.</p>

    <p>Eventually, the knight reached Wolnir. We have no idea whether it got rid of him before or after turning back to faces us for the last time. Either way, <span class="tooltip">#152<span class="tooltiptext ref152"></span></span> told us that the the time has come for the usual ritualistic feeding of the Puppet. We were once again to willingly offer our souls to it, in return for bloody combat.</p>

    <p>The arena was curious: it wasn&rsquo;t the dark grotto you find Wolnir in, but rather the preceeding room with the goblet. Here, we would face the Puppet using the same things it had to manage 3v1 or even 4v1 scenarios—only now it was a duel. This proved a challenge for many of us. Moreover, there was a yet new mechanic unique to this bossfight: the Puppet would, as far as we could tell, be able to teleport! It wasn&rsquo;t the same type of teleporting Lord of Hail utilized though. The Puppet would get out of sight, hiding behind numerous pillars. Then, as we approached the place we presumed it to be, it would reappear in some other distant corner of the room.</p>

    <p>As became the Puppeteer&rsquo;s usual tact—once all active participants got a fight or two against the Puppet, <span class="tooltip">#153<span class="tooltiptext ref153"></span></span> announced there would be just one more fight.</p>
    <p>As the last foe fell, synthetic knight&rsquo;s kill count rose to a neat 60. Simultaneously, poem <span class="tooltip">#154<span class="tooltiptext ref154"></span></span> gave a proper finish for this event. The Puppet was unfeeling, mute, &rsquo;dead&rsquo; for all intents and purposes. Yet it too needed rest. And so did everyone involved—a nine hour event has just ended, yet merely a third of what the Puppeteer promised us for this grand finale. Tomorrow, we would see him again, and witness the second third of the Puppet&rsquo;s Journey.</p>

    <p class="chapter-desc">May 12–13, 2018
        <br>The Puppet</p>

    <p>An hour before 4pm GMT, the countdown began. Our excitement was no doubt rising for we were now keenly aware that yesterday&rsquo;s nine hour event was <b>just a third</b> of everything we would see.</p>
    <p>As the countown reached zero, poem <span class="tooltip">#155<span class="tooltiptext ref155"></span></span> announced the Puppet&rsquo;s awakening. Half a day of rest was, apparently, neither calm nor soothing to the mute knight. It went on &ldquo;unfeeling&rdquo; from its &ldquo;exhausting&rdquo; slumber, likely plagued by the resurfacing memories of puppets popping in and out of its mind. It may also be alluding to the Puppeteer&rsquo;s real-life state, as the event had (and would) undoubtedly take a toll on his immediate well-being.</p>
    <p>Seeing how the Puppet was resting inside Wolnir&rsquo;s tomb, where yesterday it fought off the last waves of invaders, we were expecting it to proceed to Irithyll. The Puppeteer, however, chose a different route&mdash;to descend deeper down, into the Smouldering Lake.</p>

    <img src="assets/images/180511_twitch15.jpg" data-action="zoom"/>

    <p>The Puppet quickly traversed the long stretches of lukewarm water, and came down into the Demon Ruins. We were to search for it in this ancient maze riddled with half-dead hell-spawns. The Mad King&rsquo;s weapon art would sometimes be heard echoing somewhere near the Puppet, which only added to the atmosphere.</p>
    <p>Unlike many areas before it, we faced the regular Puppet the first time we found it: using only its familiar Arstor&rsquo;s Spear and Drakeblood Greatsword. This was the state in which Fanboy, who was one of the first ones to get a fight, found the knight.</p>

    <p>The apparent normality would soon be broken&mdash;<span class="tooltip">#156<span class="tooltiptext ref156"></span></span> warned us. The Puppet was carefully constructed by the Father, its core made of the Humanity&rsquo;s cold flame and the Lord Soul &ldquo;entwined into the formless grey&rdquo; (<span class="tooltip">#128<span class="tooltiptext ref128"></span></span>). Yet inside that synthetic mixtures lay all the dead and broken puppets we faced in the span of the last five months. Lone Darkwraith&rsquo;s apparition emerged in the Cathedral of the Deep, Redflame Erik&rsquo;s mirage in Farron Keep, and what could be described as Soul of Cinders&rsquo; intrusive presence in the Catacombs. There was just one puppet previously seen in the Smouldering Lake&mdash;Wraithflame Erik.</p>
    <p>A curious side-note: <span class="tooltip">#156<span class="tooltiptext ref156"></span></span> sheds some more light on Wraithflame&rsquo;s state. Whatever was left of it, it was &ldquo;engulfed in wrath&rdquo;. We can theorize that it was just as enraged about its poor fate during its only event at the end of January (which, if you need a refresher, is described in chapter four: LINK LINK LINK #c180127 Ashes and Stitches LINK LINK LINK). The poem also pokes fun at the Father with the last line: &ldquo;Whose cruel hand sealed such a fate?&rdquo;. As we&rsquo;ve seen throughout the story, the Father is far from being a good man. He is not perfectly evil either, rather a neutral character steadily pursuing his goal, and capable of using even malicious methods to get closer to it. Even if it meant condemning two living beings to go out as an sorry amalgamation.</p>
    <p>We didn&rsquo;t mention it yet, but the first Twtich blackground for this area was showing the Puppet fighting against the Carthus Sandworm, which appears to be a bit larger than the one we face in-game. This is, likely in the same vein as the Great Old Sin, the Puppeteer exaggerating the Puppet&rsquo;s foes for dramatic purposes.</p>
    <p>Fitting with the Twitch background, the first recorded clip of the mute knight using Wraithflame Erik&rsquo;s weapons is set right where the sandworm dies. For the sake of storytelling we may imagine that the Puppet had just murdered the beast and descended into the ruins again, only to return back when pursuing Fanboy.</p>

    <p>Surviving the encounter and venturing onwards, the Puppet was overcome by Wraithflame&rsquo;s apparition. It solidified itself in the knight&rsquo;s husk, as poem <span class="tooltip">#157<span class="tooltiptext ref157"></span></span> once more reinforced our understanding of what Wraithflame was&mdash;an ireful conglomeration of two human souls forced to coexist in a single &ldquo;cage of flesh and skin&rdquo;.</p>
    <p>It, though nothing but a vague recollection, could rage on as a brief spark. As the poem was sent, the summoning limits were turned off, and up to <b>five</b> eager invaders could challenge it at once. With more foes to face, the Puppet became more dangerous as well. Aggressive use of Power Within made its attacks devastating. This was especially true of its spear, which seemingly  benefited from a hidden Leo Ring effect, for its counter-damage was horrifying.</p>

    <p>Despite having the tools to quickly dispatch single targets, the thing found it difficult to win against our constant stream of foes. Unsurprisingly, it fell back to more reactive strategies, showing some impressive evasive skills as its health reached the critical point.</p>

    <p>We were awfully deep in the ruins, down below the ruinous remains of Ash Lake. The Puppet, awoken from its half-day slumber and revitalized by constant combat, was ravenous. It must have greatly craved our souls, for in poem <span class="tooltip">#158<span class="tooltiptext ref158"></span></span> the Puppet had temporarily threw down what control it had of its hunger.</p>
    <p>Having gone through the deepest chambers of Demon Ruins and having consumed all that was still relatively alive within, the mute knight awaited us in place of the Old Demon King.</p>

    <p>Recall what happened with the apparitions of the previous puppets the previous day. They shone the brightest during these boss encounters, when Puppet was slowly consuming them for good. This could also be the reason why we never saw the Puppet&rsquo;s main arsenal expanding, despite it having being overcome by three apparitions by now. After the boss encounter, the Pupept rids itself of the current apparition completely and ultimately, devouring whatever surfaced on its empty mind as we fought it in the area. And after that, nothing is left but more void to fill with souls, as the knight&rsquo;s hunger gnaws ever stronger.</p>
    <p>Boss of the Smouldering Lake, fitting its high-tempo music score, came at us all guns blazing. Aggressive Power Within use in combination with a buffed Firelink Greatsword made for fast-paced combat where both sides could heavily punish any mistakes the opponent had made.</p>

    <p>The fights were fast, and the opponents were plentiful. A peculiar event happened at one point: not one, but <b>two</b> opponents were challenged by the Puppet at once, (Ensign and Fanboy). Nevertheless, as the Puppet was close to finishing its feast, the time came to move forth. <span class="tooltip">#159<span class="tooltiptext ref159"></span></span> told of the final moments of Wraithflame&rsquo;s image: a feeble spark smothered by the unending flow of souls.</p>
    <p>Here came another unique moment that would begin the Puppeteer&rsquo;s continuous breaking of character. Several of us asked for one more fight for an invade who couldn&rsquo;t get in on the action. With a short <i>"Very well."</i> they were brought in, and the boss-fight extended slightly.</p>

    <p class="killcount">&mdash;80&mdash;</p>



    <p>Down in the scalding depths, Wraithflame&rsquo;s hateful apparition was subdued by the Puppet. Having made that little detour, it was ready to ascend back through the Catacombs, its mind a little less crowded with fragmented minds.</p>
    <p>Passing Wolnir&rsquo;s chamber undisturbed by us, the mute knight quickly made its way to Irithyll of the Boreal Valley.</p>

    <img src="assets/images/180511_twitch18.jpg" data-action="zoom"/>

    <p>After this momentary silence, the Puppet had once again been assaulted by a vague mirage of some distant soul. This time&mdash;a cowardly meek image of White Vagrant, as <span class="tooltip">#160<span class="tooltiptext ref160"></span></span> was quick to tell.Before we move on in the story, this poem should be given a closer look, for it speaks about the Vagrant. And because the Vagrant was one of the first puppets to &ldquo;die&rdquo;, it&rsquo;s also fairly starved for lore.</p>
    <p>We can assume that this poem, as well as virtually every other one sent during this event, is the Father speaking to us. <span class="tooltip">#160<span class="tooltiptext ref160"></span></span> presents us with four bits of information, aligned elegantly with each line. The first line tells us that White Vagrant did originate in Irithyll, but eventually left it despite being &ldquo;frail&rdquo; and &ldquo;scared&rdquo;. We can say with a fair bit of certainty that the Vagrant is not human&mdash;but a stranded white phantom. Therefore this line may be interpreted as the White Vagrant leaving its <i>world</i>, not necessarily Irithyll within it.</p>
    <p>The second line extends on this idea, saying that the Father played a role in Vagrant&rsquo;s leaving. Was he the one that separated the phantom&rsquo;s link to its original world? Did he manipulate the Vagrant to sever that link himself, seeing as he left &ldquo;entwined in Father&rsquo;s strings&rdquo;? We do not know, but it&rsquo;s clear that the Father intended the Vagrant to be stranded between worlds.</p>
    <p>The third line reaffirms our belief that Father did not think highly of Vagrant&rsquo;s resolve and will. This may be precisely why it fell into Father&rsquo;s trap and became a vagrant.</p>
    <p>The last line is perhaps the most interesting. Why would the Father need such a weak-willed cowardly puppet, if their primary purpose was to fight? Well, this line single-handedly links White Vagrant to the &ldquo;ancient sun&rdquo;. And what could be that sun? The old gods of Lordran, and Gwyn. (Though as we will learn just a bit later from <span class="tooltip">#165<span class="tooltiptext ref165"></span></span>, it&rsquo;s more likely that it alludes to Gwynevere, not Gwyn). This link is extremely important for Oden, because it gives is the answer as to <i>why</i> merging him with the Vagrant&rsquo;s remains catalyzed the return of his memories as the Lord of Hail.</p>
    <p>Why would the Vagrant be linked to the gods? Well, our best bet is to look at the irithyllian face preset in the character creation menu.</p>
    <blockquote>The features of the old gods, as if from legend. They say children born like this are fated to be taken to the Boreal Valley.</blockquote>
    <p>So while it&rsquo;s going a bit out there in terms of whether it could have been thought-through by the Puppeteer himself, this does gives us a pretty solid footing for the Vagrant&rsquo;s origin: it was born a distant descendant of the gods, and because of that it was at some point brought to Irithyll, from which it was then lead astray by the Father.</p>
    <p>Moving on from such narrow lore details, the Puppet has crossed the bridge and entered Irithyll. Immediately, it gifted is with a fantastic show of PvE skills, only to be promptly dispatched for such an extraordinary display:</p>

    <button class="collapsible"><i class="fas fa-film"></i>Narcolept witnessing the Puppet's divine skills<i class="fas fa-angle-double-down" style="float: right;"></i></button>
    <div class="collapsible_content">

    </div>

    <p>The first Twitch image has show Vagrant&rsquo;s growing influence on the synthetic knight. The exact moments are unclear, but it has gradually acquired Vagrant&rsquo;s weapons as it progressed through the area. If we were to tie it to some landmarks in the area, it likely went like this: Pontiff Knight&rsquo;s Curved Sword appeared around the very start, and the Murakumo somewhere in the middle of the area.</p>
    <p>The Puppet made quick and steady progress through Irithyll&rsquo;s winding streets, fighting off lonely invaders and sometimes letting several people in at once. One such battle happened right before the lake, with the Puppet (unsuccessfully) fending off three invaders at once:</p>

    <button class="collapsible"><i class="fas fa-film"></i>Qy and co. in the high-speed murder-blender action<i class="fas fa-angle-double-down" style="float: right;"></i></button>
    <div class="collapsible_content">
        <div class="youtube" data-embed="urqRDlW-FJw"><div class="play-button"></div></div>
    </div>

    <p>As it inevitably got back and pressed on, it came across a single lonely room warmed by a fireplace. The stream&rsquo;s background changed, and poem <span class="tooltip">#161<span class="tooltiptext ref161"></span></span> was sent.</p>

    <img src="assets/images/180511_twitch19.jpg" data-action="zoom"/>

    <p>This poem confirms in a straight manner, that the room where you&rsquo;d find Siegward in the main game <i>is</i> the Father&rsquo;s &ldquo;shack&rdquo;, where he worked on the Puppet and, probably, also where he ended to all of his previous marionettes. The second half of <span class="tooltip">#161<span class="tooltiptext ref161"></span></span> likely refers to the Father transporting the Puppet out from this shack to the High Wall of Lothric, where it has awoken. And the &ldquo;Divine&rdquo; would be either the Soul of Cinders&mdash;the Puppet&rsquo;s ultimate goal, or the Lords of Cinders&mdash;the foes it had to overcome along the way.</p>

    </div>

    <p>Nearing Pontiff, the Puppet was ruthless and eager to not linger around any more. It&rsquo;s also around here that we saw an interesting pattern: the Puppet not only consumed souls and grew stronger statistically, but also seemingly learned and used our fighting styles as well! What prompted this idea was the aggressive use of Murakumo&rsquo;s jumping attacks&mdash;a remarkable feature of Kallah&rsquo;s playstyle. Another example of such &ldquo;learned behavior&rdquo; would be Narcolept&rsquo;s tendency to redirect charged R2 attacks depending on the situation. Perhaps the Puppeteer intended this details, perhaps it was simply a coincidence of similar playstyles. Either way, last fights were fought, last souls collected. Now came another boss-fight for us.</p>

    <p><span class="tooltip">#162<span class="tooltiptext ref162"></span></span> beckoned us to the fog gate. Alongside that, we have learned that White Vagrant&rsquo;s apparition was more feeble than the other ones. This is why it&rsquo;s also the first boss-fight which did not mirror the area&rsquo;s respective puppet completely. The &ldquo;Vagrant&rdquo; in Puppet&rsquo;s flesh used its proper weapons, only this time they were also augmented with frostbite&mdash;a buff the original Vagrant never possessed.</p>
    <p>This fight had proven brutal for a lot of us. Murakumo was already doing massive damage, and it was made only deadlier by the constant danger of frostbite hanging over us. Combine those statistical dangers with the Puppet&rsquo;s in-your-face playstyle, and it became an awfully dangerous opponent.</p>

    </div>

    <p>Another thing that was special about this particular boss-fight is that it had two stages. In the first one, the challengers faced the mute knight on the lower level of Pontiff&rsquo;s Cathedral&mdash;a wide, open area with lots of space to maneuver. But about halfway through the fights, the Puppet would force a break and ride the elevator up to the second floor. There, it would face us again, this time in a much more narrow space where both sides could potentially be forced into a corner.</p>
    <p>As we, in the regular fashion, each got a fight or two against the Vagrant&rsquo;s apparition, poem <span class="tooltip">#163<span class="tooltiptext ref163"></span></span> quickly announced the end of the fight. White Vagrant&rsquo;s last remaining memory was smothered and consumed by the Puppet just as quickly as its body was decimated by us several months ago. Now, in the temporary respite of an empty mind, the Puppet would ascend up to the derelict asylum of the gods&mdash;Anor Londo.</p>

    /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

    <p>The event continued, with the beginning being the same as the last time - a countdown every ten minutes or so before the actual start. Poem <span class="tooltip">#149<span class="tooltiptext ref149"></span></span> was posted after reaching 0:
        <br>
        <br><span class="tooltip">#149<span class="tooltiptext ref149"></span></span>
        <br>Knight wakes from its exhausting slumber.
        <br>Unfeeling, mute, it carries on
        <br>led by prime glutton in its wander,
        <br>till greatest foe is dead and gone.
    </p>
    <p>The event continued in the Demon ruins, where power within was added to the Puppet&rsquo;s repertoire, making his attacks devastating. This held especially true for the consecutive spear pokes. Here, some speculated that the Puppet may have some kind of increased Leo ring effect on the thrust attacks of the spear, as the damage difference between a normal 2hR1 poke vs. 2hR1 poke counter hit was massive. Going through the area, the Puppeteer posted two more poems:
        <br>
        <br><span class="tooltip">#150<span class="tooltiptext ref150"></span></span>
        <br>Next apparition starts to stand
        <br>engulfed in wrath of its poor state:
        <br>within, two different minds it rend.
        <br>Whose cruel hand sealed such a fate?
        <br>
        <br><span class="tooltip">#151<span class="tooltiptext ref151"></span></span>
        <br>Their flame is not like that of Sin -
        <br>a seething rage of human mind
        <br>trapped in a cage of flesh and skin.
        <br>In mutual destruction solace find.
    </p>
    <p>Eventually, the invaders were told to once again place red summon signs in front of the Old Demon King boss fight, as instructed in poem <span class="tooltip">#152<span class="tooltiptext ref152"></span></span>:
        <br>
        <br><span class="tooltip">#152<span class="tooltiptext ref152"></span></span>
        <br>Amidst the corpse of ancient kin,
        <br>the hunger is contained no more.
        <br>By placing signs you can begin
        <br>to feed it like you did before.
    </p>
    <p>Interestingly, for one boss fight, the Puppeteer summoned two people - Ensign and Fanboy simultaneously. Before the &ldquo;final&rdquo; summoning, we received poem <span class="tooltip">#153<span class="tooltiptext ref153"></span></span>:
        <br>
        <br><span class="tooltip">#153<span class="tooltiptext ref153"></span></span>
        <br>Mirage so hateful fades away
        <br>subdued by sound of ripping souls.
        <br>A hollow husk waits for the day
        <br>when world, at last, no one controls.
        <br>
        <br>1 LEFT
    </p>
    <p>However, two more people were summoned, as the Puppeteer proved very understanding and respected a request made for one invader to get a go at the boss, as they had not had a chance to fight due to some... fooling around from another member. Following the second fight, we received poem <span class="tooltip">#154<span class="tooltiptext ref154"></span></span>:
        <br>
        <br><span class="tooltip">#154<span class="tooltiptext ref154"></span></span>
        <br>A frail scared soul once from here left
        <br>entwined in strings my hand had spun.
        <br>The mind was waste, of will bereft,
        <br>...but soul had smelled of ancient sun.
    </p>
    <p>In Irithyll, the Puppet added a pontiff knight curved sword to his arsenal. As the Puppet reached the room with the fireplace, the one where it seemed to be crafted in the pictures we received, a poem was posted:
        <br>
        <br><span class="tooltip">#155<span class="tooltiptext ref155"></span></span>
        <br>The warmth of lonely fireplace
        <br>does it recall this shack of mine?
        <br>To castle guided with great pace
        <br>to start its journey for Divine.
    </p>
    <p>Arriving at the Pontiff Sulyvahn boss fog after fighting off the invaders throughout the level, we were once again challenged to fight the Puppet.
        <br>
        <br><span class="tooltip">#156<span class="tooltiptext ref156"></span></span>
        <br>Mute knight will not recall in true,
        <br>mirage so transient and meek.
        <br>Its afterglow to now subdue,
        <br>leave signs by fog and catch a peek.
    </p>
    <p>Fitting to the level&rsquo;s theme, in the boss fight the Puppet used the combination of a main hand Murakumo (with an Irithyll weapon visual effect) and an off-hand PKCS. Here, the Puppet utilized a lot of jumping attacks with the CGS, as if mimicking the behavior of Kallah - sparking some conversation on how the Puppet seems to be learning over time, adding our strategies and moves into its bag of tricks; another example would be Narcolept re-directing charged R2 attacks. The fight consisted of two parts, the first taking place in the lower part of the boss room area, while the second took place on the area up the elevator. Feeling the Puppets thirst in this area almost sated, poem <span class="tooltip">#157<span class="tooltiptext ref157"></span></span> appeared in chat:
        <br>
        <br><span class="tooltip">#157<span class="tooltiptext ref157"></span></span>
        <br>Ah, afterimage fades so soon,
        <br>just as it did in flesh and bone.
        <br>Meanwhile, lit by calm and peaceful moon
        <br>knight keeps his restless march alone.
        <br>
        <br>1 LEFT
    </p>
    <p>The area post-Pontiff was skipped, going straight to Anor Londo. This was most likely done to avoid excess problems with random invaders, and to allow us an easier time to enter the Puppet&rsquo;s world. In Anor Londo, the Puppet once more returned to the combination of Arstor&rsquo;s spear main hand, drakeblood GS off-hand. Passing through the cathedral halls, the Puppeteer added another poem:
        <br>
        <br><span class="tooltip">#158<span class="tooltiptext ref158"></span></span>
        <br>"O palace of the venerable sun.
        <br>What sight to see thy ruins fall"
        <br>- age-dried lips had soon begun,
        <br>in walking through the darkened hall.
    </p>
    <p>Instead of fighting the Puppet in the Aldrich boss area, we were instead instructed to place our sign in the Darkmoon tomb...
        <br>
        <br><span class="tooltip">#159<span class="tooltiptext ref159"></span></span>
        <br>Infused with image of old Mother,
        <br>slept deep as half-dead dragon sage,
        <br>Come, apparition this now smother,
        <br>to tomb below this relic of old Age.
    </p>
    <p>The fight took place on top of the grave, inside the room behind the illusory wall. In this fight, the Puppet used a zweihander + wolf knight shield combo, along with a partizan. These dealt magic damage and had a frost effect on their model. The zwei had both stomp and neck swipe weapon arts. During these fights, the kill count of the Puppet reached one hundred - the notification posted was bolded to highlight the milestone. The fight here seemed to go on at a much lower pace with the Puppet being far less active than in the previous ones, mimicking the song playing in the background - sad, eerie and slow in tempo. As always, the last combatant summoned was preceded by a poem
        <br>
        <br><span class="tooltip">#160<span class="tooltiptext ref160"></span></span>
        <br>In slumber gluttons knight yet more,
        <br>and then breaks free of veiled tangle.
        <br>Sin&rsquo;s Flame is here, god-eating whore!
        <br>Tear out, engulf, poor thing then strangle.
        <br>
        <br>1 LEFT
    </p>
    <p>Content with his results, the Puppeteer decided to hold a short break, leaving us with <span class="tooltip">#161<span class="tooltiptext ref161"></span></span>:
        <br>
        <br><span class="tooltip">#161<span class="tooltiptext ref161"></span></span>
        <br>What gruesome mess it seems to be
        <br>devouring Lords&rsquo; blazing soul.
        <br>Half-hour break for knight to see
        <br>accursed force it dares now hold.
    </p>
    <p>After the break, we moved on to the Irithyll dungeon area, with more text being left to us:
        <br>
        <br><span class="tooltip">#162<span class="tooltiptext ref162"></span></span>
        <br>Ah, Great Sin&rsquo;s old flame warm and sublime
        <br>engulfs the Puppet as it feeds.
        <br>Thick priest of old who ate Divine -
        <br>mere food for one who Flame now needs.
    </p>
    <p>In the dungeon area, the Puppet&rsquo;s weapons gained even more fire effects - especially the visual that appears on-hit. New spells were seen here: floating chaos (with a custom casting animation, seemed to be that of the way of white corona) and some kind of large explosion - those that Nameless Flame used. While the Puppet&rsquo;s progress was halted at times, he eventually managed to get through the level, leaving us with another poem some half-way through:
        <br>
        <br><span class="tooltip">#163<span class="tooltiptext ref163"></span></span>
        <br>Invasive blaze shrieks through these cells,
        <br>it scorches soul and flesh alike.
        <br>As eyes are veiled by oldest hells,
        <br>knight&rsquo;s soul takes shape I so dislike.
    </p>
    <p>Eventually, making its way past the room with multiple jailers, we received a poem usually reserved for red sign summonings:
        <br>
        <br><span class="tooltip">#164<span class="tooltiptext ref164"></span></span>
        <br>Knight&rsquo;s soul fears not this game,
        <br>for with each Lord it becomes more
        <br>like Old, Accursed, Great Sin&rsquo;s Flame.
        <br>...
        <br>till naught is left but molten core.
        <br>
        <br>1 LEFT
    </p>
    <p>After getting one more kill under its belt, the Puppet moved to Archdragon peak, signaled via poem <span class="tooltip">#165<span class="tooltiptext ref165"></span></span>:
        <br>
        <br><span class="tooltip">#165<span class="tooltiptext ref165"></span></span>
        <br>Invoke storm clouds a distant though
        <br>of life so long it had no start.
        <br>Knight seeks what it once sought,
        <br>yet couldn&rsquo;t get, too weak of heart.
    </p>
    <p>Here, he utilized the arms and spells Lord of hail had. These included an Astora greatsword which still had the custom WAs the Arstor&rsquo;s spear had, along with a new one - a curved sword spin with a large knockback effect. Spells included a gust of wind (using the black flame animation) that knocked down his adversaries, a lighting spear combed with a shot from the Smouldering lake ballista. Scoring several kills in the area before the Wyvern boss, the invaders got a message:
        <br>
        <br><span class="tooltip">#166<span class="tooltiptext ref166"></span></span>
        <br>As you endure this path as well,
        <br>and yield so many souls to it,
        <br>feel you the weight of things that dwell,
        <br>within this shell a Lord befit?
    </p>
    <p>Moving through the area past the Dragonkin Mausoleum, the Puppet seemed to grow stronger than when entering the area, acquiring multiple attacks capable of 3-shotting its challenger. Reaching the area after the Great Belfry, the Puppet began using teleportation spells that utilized floating energy orbs as hotpoints. After several encounters, we were once again beckoned to challenge the creation one-on-one:
        <br>
        <br><span class="tooltip">#167<span class="tooltiptext ref167"></span></span>
        <br>True apparition, adept of storm,
        <br>hangs over knight, stronger than most.
        <br>As bell bleeds through the cloud&rsquo;s swarm,
        <br>Come to the fog, engage the ghost.
    </p>
    <p>The boss fight in Archdragon peak was held in the open area that is unlocked after defeating Nameless king, with two orbs present. Besting this Puppet proved the greatest challenge yet, due to a combination of fast, strong attacks - both magical and physical, along with the teleporting and multiple uses of regeneration-inducing souls. One final challenger was summoned, accompanied by poem 168:
        <br>
        <br><span class="tooltip">#168<span class="tooltiptext ref168"></span></span>
        <br>Bleak stones we paint by blood of Ash,
        <br>as their souls nurture voiceless knight.
        <br>Time comes for fate to make another dash
        <br>More Flames are left to feed its might
        <br>
        <br>1 LEFT
    </p>
    <p>After another climactic face-off, the Puppeteer ended the event for this day:
        <br>
        <br><span class="tooltip">#169<span class="tooltiptext ref169"></span></span>
        <br>As sun fades from the titan sky,
        <br>all beasts and men fall down in shade.
        <br>The knight again closes his eye:
        <br>rests mute, unbent, unswayed.
    </p>
    <p>An interesting note is that throughout the day, the Puppeteer seemed to interact with us in chat more than ever before - emoting, listening to request of some players short on time/that didn&rsquo;t get to have a go at one of the bosses, posting a high-resolution image of one picture Narcolept saved from the stream, and responding to Nosferat&rsquo;s request to release all of the images.</p>

    /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

    <p>Amazingly, as we started off our run, a special someone joined VC chat... the Puppeteer, who was muted, but could very well hear what we talked about, commenting on what&rsquo;s happening in sometimes very cheeky ways.</p>
    <p>The run continued in Profaned capital, accompanied by poem <span class="tooltip">#170<span class="tooltiptext ref170"></span></span>:
        <br><span class="tooltip">#170<span class="tooltiptext ref170"></span></span>
        <br>Amidst the putrid toxic trash
        <br>once walked a weary, lonely one.
        <br>Foes resolutely would he crush -
        <br>though just a cripple on the run.
    </p>
    <p>Aquamarine dagger was added to the weaponry of the Puppet. Quite soon after beginning the event, we received an invitation for red sign summons in poem 171:
        <br>
        <br><span class="tooltip">#171<span class="tooltiptext ref171"></span></span>
        <br>The truest traitor of his race,
        <br>devolved to mere old nameless thing.
        <br>Now vaguely image shows its face,
        <br>before the Lord on throne of king.
    </p>
    <p>Boss weapons: aquamarine dagger, Astora greatsword, partizan. These did not seem to have custom WAs. Visually, the Puppet was missing one arm, mimicking Oden the Armless. In the fight, the Puppet was especially aggressive when taking out the aquamarine. As always, we got two poems before the run moved onto the next area:
        <br>
        <br><span class="tooltip">#172<span class="tooltiptext ref172"></span></span>
        <br>In silence watched by titan two,
        <br>who fight before his giant soul.
        <br>Fear not, poor sufferer, you too,
        <br>will eaten be alive and whole.
        <br>
        <br>1 LEFT
        <br>
        <br><span class="tooltip">#173<span class="tooltiptext ref173"></span></span>
        <br>Lord dead and gone in gaping maw
        <br>No man or god is now the knight -
        <br>a Sin at which great hungers gnaw,
        <br>a monster with a soul so bright.
    </p>
    <p>In Lothric castle, the Puppet returned to using explosion-based spells, along with a new one - a combination of Farron dart and seething chaos: the projectile did some damage along with a slight knockback; the falling point of the projectile marking the seething chaos mine spot. Here, almost all invasions were Xv1s, as the Puppeteer seemed to keep the invader count limit disabled. Poems 173-175 all came bolded, as if the Puppet was overwhelmed with the enormous power it had acquired, the kill count rising to almost 150.
        <br>
        <br><span class="tooltip">#174<span class="tooltiptext ref174"></span></span>
        <br>No apparition is this flame -
        <br>new certain state of hollow thing.
        <br>Great Sin of Old it is to blame,
        <br>for this great burden it doth bring.
        <br>
        <br><span class="tooltip">#175<span class="tooltiptext ref175"></span></span>
        <br>As embers flicker in the air
        <br>hot wind blows from the sacred sin.
        <br>Sign stones by fog now, if you dare
        <br>to face the thing to hell akin.
    </p>
    <p>In the boss fight, the Puppet utilized area-of-denial spells extensively. Floating chaos was almost constantly present, and multiple mines were cast in an attempt to corner any challenger. The neck swipe weapon art also proved deadlier than ever, dealing ridiculous amounts of damage. The weapons used were the same as in the Irithyll dungeon: Arstor&rsquo;s spear and Drakeblood greatsword, with the noticeable visual flame buff.</p>
    <p>The boss fight proved extremely challenging, with very few succeeding. Eventually, by subduing enough opponents, the Puppet seemed to recover control to some extent:
        <br>
        <br><span class="tooltip">#176<span class="tooltiptext ref176"></span></span>
        <br>Flame rages on in cursed soul
        <br>as knight subdues it with stern will:
        <br>ought not it waste this precious coal,
        <br>left final Lord to gulp with thrill.
        <br>
        <br>1 LEFT
    </p>
    <p>After striking the last challenger down, the run moved to Untended graves, where the Puppet mimicked Nameless Flame&rsquo;s final form, his head covered in a black mist akin to that of harald knights in TRC. He utilized a blackflame-buffed onyx blade, ringed knight sword and spear, and several black pyromancies along with the close-range explosion spell from before. We did not stay in this area for too long, the Puppet reaching the boss fog quite quickly:
        <br>
        <br><span class="tooltip">#177<span class="tooltiptext ref177"></span></span>
        <br>A fleeting spark of human soul
        <br>engulfs the knight in veil&rsquo;s blacks.
        <br>Fog now approach, for it&rsquo;s your goal
        <br>to all provide what it still lacks.
    </p>
    <p>The boss fight in the untended graves was very unique: while the first challenger was summoned into a 1v1 duel, later opponents were brought in as duos, with players fighting the Puppet in the area around the abandoned Firelink shrine. The fight consisted of two parts; first fighting in the area right after Champion Gundyr, after which the Puppet would retreat into the shrine where the second part would begin. The black knights in the area targeted the Puppet, giving the discorders some helping hands in defeating the power-hungry adversary. Eventually, we received poems 178 and 179, signaling a small break.
        <br>
        <br><span class="tooltip">#178<span class="tooltiptext ref178"></span></span>
        <br>As black gives way to scorching steel,
        <br>knight leaves the human flame aside.
        <br>Tasked now to finish final meal,
        <br>it marches on, Sin its one guide.
        <br>
        <br>1 LEFT
        <br>
        <br><span class="tooltip">#179<span class="tooltiptext ref179"></span></span>
        <br>From dark emerged a single face,
        <br>encased in bent and broken steel.
        <br>Exhausted yet from this long race,
        <br>half-hour break it takes to kneel!
    </p>
    <p>After the break, the Puppet headed to the Grand archives:
        <br>
        <br><span class="tooltip">#180<span class="tooltiptext ref180"></span></span>
        <br>Last apparition still to feed
        <br>whom yielded flesh for monster mute.
        <br>To its homeland no roads yet lead -
        <br>one cannot go without a route.
    </p>
    <p>Here, he had new spells that utilized the particle/visual effects of those used by Lothric, younger prince. These included small darts and large explosions of light. At the beginning of the area, the Puppet used the Arstor-Drakeblood combo. The damage seemed to have increased yet again, as some people found themselves mercilessly struck down in mere three blows, should they fail to find an opportunity to heal. Passing through the archives, the Puppeteer posted:
        <br>
        <br><span class="tooltip">#181<span class="tooltiptext ref181"></span></span>
        <br>Corpse given to the voiceless knight
        <br>holds not the tale of Spears sublime.
        <br>Yet in these halls of white sunlight -
        <br>a different tale of ancient crime.
    </p>
    <p>At the top of the archives, the weaponry was changed once more: the Puppet now was rocking the combo of Lucerne and Gotthards. Defeated one final time on the way to the Twin Princes boss fog, red signs were requested:
        <br>
        <br><span class="tooltip">#182<span class="tooltiptext ref182"></span></span>
        <br>Amalgam of the sunlit prison
        <br>along with feathers airy and white.
        <br>Your signs awaits image arisen,
        <br>from knight enduring fevered light.
    </p>
    <p>In the boss fight, the Puppet used gold pine bundles to push the damage even further. By this point, the spells Lothric used were becoming larger and larger in size. One more challenger was beckoned in a familiar way:
        <br>
        <br><span class="tooltip">#183<span class="tooltiptext ref183"></span></span>
        <br>Fake imitation of the old
        <br>won&rsquo;t dare take up more time.
        <br>Just over here, last Lord so cold,
        <br>the last banquet of this great climb.
        <br>
        <br>1 LEFT
    </p>
    <p>After the final battle here, we were told to move on to the Kiln of the First Flame...
        <br>
        <br><span class="tooltip">#184<span class="tooltiptext ref184"></span></span>
        <br>Our goal is clear, for we are done.
        <br>No lords or souls are left to eat.
        <br>Great Sin of Old, your time has come!
        <br>This hellish knight will do the feat.
    </p>
    <p>Here, something unexpected happened. We were summoned ALONGSIDE the Puppet to combat the Soul of Cinder in a 5v1 engagement. Having absorbed its soul, the fight was followed up by a similar one... 5v1s against the now-strengthened Puppet:
        <br>
        <br><span class="tooltip">#186<span class="tooltiptext ref186"></span></span>
        <br>INTO THICK ASH THE PIECES FALL
        <br>STRONG JAW SUBDUES THE BLAZING HEAD
        <br>WORLD&rsquo;S FLAME WILL NOT STAND TALL
        <br>AS KNIGHT ENGULFS ITS FINAL SHRED
    </p>
    <p>Multiple times, five people were summoned. Multiple times, we killed the Puppet. Yet every time, it stood back up, becoming stronger, faster. In fights, the Puppet began to deal massive damage, enough to two-shot almost any given opponent, while moving with an enormous speed. He also seemed to acquire passive hyper armor as some attacks did not make him flinch at all. The fights required a decent amount of co-operation from the discorders, as not to hit one another, while also covering those under attack. Finally, one last battle was indicated to occur:
        <br>
        <br><span class="tooltip">#187<span class="tooltiptext ref187"></span></span>
        <br>AS SKY GROWS DARK IN ENDLESS NIGHT
        <br>ONE SPARK IS LEFT, UNTAMED AND BRIGHT
        <br>COME EACH ONE NOW, FOR FINAL FIGHT
        <br>SOON ENDLESS REST WILL TAKE THE KNIGHT.
        <br>
        <br>1 LEFT
    </p>
    <p>With the final group of five managing to defeat the Puppet, it was finally over. The months-long journey was complete:
        <br>
        <br><span class="tooltip">#188<span class="tooltiptext ref188"></span></span>
        <br>This world, old and decayed,
        <br>it now, alas, no one controls.

    <p>But it was not over. Not yet. Once more, we returned to the Untended graves, where we had one final set of showdowns, via red sign summons To preserve the impact of these fights, we will not be documenting anything here - please watch the videos, for which we will hopefully be able to acquire the music the Puppeteer played in the background. For some, the emotional impact was... enormous.</p>
    <p>Eventually, the Puppeteer announced that the invaders would be given one last attempt to fight. Asked to provide a name, Fanboy spoke up, naming his character, Valerie of Carim - which was accepted by a couple others as a fitting final opponent for the Puppet.</p>
    <p>After the fight, we were instructed to place our red signs one final time, but now not for a fight... again, what transpired here will not be documented in text to preserve the impact - please watch the videos.</p>
    <p>Content with the results of all of his work over the past several months, the Puppeteer posted one final poem:
        <br><span class="tooltip">#189<span class="tooltiptext ref189"></span></span>
        <br>Knight takes a seat under dark bell,
        <br>great deed is done, the embers fade.
        <br>It now shall rest, enchain the hell
        <br>till even time itself will fade.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>-THE END-
    </p>
    <p>Following which, he finally broke character completely, letting us have a Q&A session regards to, well, anything related to the project and him... if you want to read our questions and the Puppeteer&rsquo;s answers, please check out the Puppeteer-related channel on the SL90 discord, <span class="tooltip">#01010000<span class="tooltiptext ref01010000"></span></span>.</p>
    <p>During the event, the Puppeteer used Twitch to add custom music to the boss segments of the run, as well as provide some background imagery. Whole collection of images can be found here: https://imgur.com/a/Yct4b7M</p>

    <p>After the story has ended on May 14, the Puppeteer has broken character and spoke to us normally. During this time, he encouraged us to ask him any questions related to the story. Keep in mind - this was never positioned as a serious back-and-forth Q&A. Both sides had fun and joked around.</p>

            <br>Nameless Flame - a total blast to play as.

            <br>And he who is strong to the bone,
            <br>Who us with his presence graces
            <br>Whose legacy written in stone.
            <br>
            <br>There lies he, beneath the still bell,
            <br>For now his noble work is done;
            <br>He rest til the dark bell shall knell
            <br>That is never, our hearts he won.

But life is a busy dickhead and also large quantities of alcohol are surprisingly bad. Anyway, I dont have any questions. Just wanted to say thanks and playing against you was very fun.</td></tr>
        <tr><td class="Q">Edvard The Crag:</td><td>It’s quite amazing that our Puppetmaster here even shows the restraint required to know when to end things. A rather important theme in Dark Souls too, peaceful submission! Least if you ask me anyway.</td></tr>

        <tr><td class="Q">Tikaro:</td><td>The Puppeteer&rsquo;s story was a very unique and remarkable thing to participate in. I&rsquo;ve always been a fan of weird storytelling and grim plots, so it hit all the right spots for me. I&rsquo;m really sad that I wasn&rsquo;t able to directly participate in a lot of the events, because it played out during a very busy point of my life. I have even managed to miss the entirety of the finale! Nevertheless, I did my best to keep up with the story, which is why I managed the Puppeteer Google Doc. And now (July–August 2018), when I have more free time to spare, I have condensed all the information I could gather into this compact, readable version. With this, I hope that the Puppeteer&rsquo;s story will live on, and that it will inspire more people to do creative roleplaying.</td></tr>
        <tr class="space"></tr>
        <tr><td class="Q">Raff:</td><td>Thanks to Tikaro for managing the document for us.  It was too much of a hassle to record many of the events, but rest assured I was there for many of them.  This has been the highlight of the server in my eyes, and I couldn&rsquo;t have asked for anything better.  Peace y&rsquo;all.</td></tr>
        <tr class="space"></tr>
        <tr><td class="Q">qy:</td><td>The Puppeteer was the most memorable PvP experience that I&rsquo;ve had in a game. It was amazing to watch as a cryptic narrative unfolded before us, and to participate in the in-game events it spawned. It&rsquo;s really a special thing to have a player who takes tools used for cheating and instead using them to enrich the experiences of others, and the Puppeteer executed it perfectly. I&rsquo;ll never forget it.</td></tr>
        <tr class="space"></tr>
        <tr><td class="Q">Fanboy:</td><td>Encountering the Puppeteer as late as it happened during DS3’s life cycle was a true blessing. When I joined the SL90 server, for which he crafted his story, the game was already 2 years old. Most of what could have been squeezed out of the game… had probably been squeezed out. It was very difficult to come up with something new. Despite this, the Puppeteer delivered to us an amazing, cryptic tale in true Soulsborne fashion, spanning across several months.
            <p>From everything I saw during this time, I can without a doubt say that the Puppeteer has an incredible creative mind, and a beastly work ethic. Just some of the things that showcase this are: the CE usage and the intensive testing that must have gone into it. The images he made in Photoshop, which some of the community members described as “professional-like”. The poems and riddles thrown our way, which we tried to decipher while waiting for his next appearance in-game. The music choices to which the final puppet would act, and the PvP skill needed to pull it off… Obviously, none of this could have been done if said person did not absolutely love the game, or perhaps even the whole series.</p>
            <p>The finale, the DF run through the game, left me and many others physically and emotionally drained. We stayed up into the early hours of the morning for several days straight, just to see the ending that was made for us… and also had to deal with saying goodbye to one of our beloved community members. The latter hit me very hard during the last hour-and-a-half or so of the event, just as the final boss fights began. I had to remove myself from VC because I was brought to tears, for I knew we would most likely not meet again.</p>
            <p>Thank you for this experience, the memories of which I will continue to treasure.</p></td></tr>
