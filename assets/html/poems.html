<p class="poem" id="poem1">#1 (sent to Varyag)
    <br>Are you the knightess of Blackflame?
    <br>She was a fierce companion.
    <br>Exists a kinship 'tween us witches
    <br>the one my rotten soul has long abandoned.
    <br>
    <br>From flame we came and there we'll meet.
    <br>Of Dark and Light we two were born.
    <br>But this one hollow soldier's meat,
    <br>has long ago decayed to bone.
</p>
<p class="poem" id="poem2">#2 (sent to Cephalon Vezir)
    <br>A dragon beast in shape of man!
    <br>I'm but a doll but I'm impressed.
    <br>Your blades have weight and might and fury,
    <br>but what you lack is some finesse.
    <br>
    <br>Mark words of mine, you lonely knight,
    <br>From such a warlike tribe you come!
    <br>Flee now and tell of joy so bright:
    <br>"Our Father shall at last return!
</p>
<p class="poem" id="poem3">#3 (sent to Alex_)
    <br>I thank you kindly, nameless knight!
    <br>Right here I embered will remain.
    <br>To fight you truly is a fright,
    <br>my gratitude you here obtain!
</p>
<p class="poem" id="poem4">#4 (sent to Narcolept)
    <br>Four children slumber in the dirt,
    <br>They are the Father's joy and pride
    <br>They all forsook this hallow earth,
    <br>In battle you have made them thrive.
    <br>***
    <br>I am now blocked by man with finger.
    <br>His world cannot I terrorize.
    <br>Around Redflame despite this lingers,
    <br>Go tell him: “I apologize!”
</p>
<p class="poem" id="poem5">#5 (sent to Alex_)
    <br>The blood has spilled, the flame is sated,
    <br>I thank you kindly, wayward knight!
    <br>For long my brethren have waited,
    <br>We all arise, prepare to fight!
    <br>
    <br>From faraway has travelled first,
    <br>second's but a phantom ripple
    <br>Third of Abyss, next of a flaming thirst.
    <br>The last is but an armless cripple.
    <br>[0001/0100]
</p>
<p class="poem" id="poem6">#6 (sent to Narcolept)
    <br>They all await the Father's hand,
    <br>his skillful arms which stitch and heal.
    <br>“Go wage great wars!” – was his demand,
    <br>at last they fell from blades you wield.
    <br>[0010/0100]
</p>
<p class="poem" id="poem7">#7 (sent to Narcolept)
    <br>Once they were warriors so great,
    <br>now broken puppets throw away!
    <br>All this is following the fate,
    <br>Stitched they no longer are astray.
    <br>[0011/0100]
</p>
<p class="poem" id="poem8">#8 (sent to Paprika)
    <br>The final goal has long been set:
    <br>to kill the Flame, the god of all.
    <br>For that the warrior to get,
    <br>forced five of us to fall.
    <br>[0100/????]
</p>
<p class="poem" id="poem9">#9 (sent to Jean)
    <br>This is the end, the Father waits,
    <br>Our skin is longing for some stitches
    <br>Today you saw at last the gates!
    <br>Come morrow three shall drown in riches.
    <br>[1111/1111]
</p>
<p class="poem" id="poem10">#10 (sent to Tikaro)
    <br>O ruined knight, come hear me now!
    <br>Pay close attention to my word,
    <br>Not four, but five has made the vow,
    <br>the doll forgotten is the eastward.
    <br>[0101/????]
</p>
<p class="poem" id="poem11">#11 (sent to Narcolept)
    <br>He guards the derelicts alone,
    <br>ferocious man once could have been.
    <br>The ruins now he calls a home,
    <br>'till Father stitching will begin.
</p>
<p class="poem" id="poem12">#12 (sent to Discord)
    <br>What fun we've?had in our maze!
    <br>At last all puppets brought together.
    <br>They shall away for four more days,
    <br>But?they'll return from the cold nether.
    <br>
    <br>My stage is set, show must begin!
    <br>I'll lend a?hand, keep this in mind:
    <br>“Count well, forgotten one has?been.
    <br>Soon shall?the two in one unite“
</p>
<p class="poem" id="poem13">#13 (sent to Narcolept)
    <br>Work of you men has been fantastic,
    <br>No thing could save the broken two!
    <br>Yet Father had the plan so drastic,
    <br>in day or two shall witness you.

    <br>For long he laid in pygmys' dust,
    <br>your wars have woken him again.
    <br>At last he sheds the eons' rust
    <br>to bring you to a tragic end.
</p>
<p class="poem" id="poem29">#29
    <br>Oh yes, he's angry, mad, insane,
    <br>still just a puppet long enchained.
    <br>Go bring upon him cold steel bane -
    <br>there are good parts that could be gained.
</p>
<p class="poem" id="poem30">#30
    <br>Why 'Heart” I wonder, for that thing?
    <br>Its own long gone from cursed spear.
    <br>Could frail beast still something bring?
    <br>Naught left but fright and force so sheer.
</p>
<p class="poem" id="poem31">#31
    <br>What's that, I'll find him <b>broken</b>?
    <br>Oh please, don't make me laugh.
    <br>He one withstood the force unspoken,
    <br>the titan Lord's acursed staff.
</p>
<p class="poem" id="poem32">#32 (sent to noxuary)
    <br>Hmm, I've found him early in my quest,
    <br>No one could keep his rage at bay
    <br>By titan Lord was put to rest –
    <br>And I made sure he'd stay that way.
</p>
<p class="poem" id="poem33">#33 (sent to Narcolept)
    <br>Come now, 'fore church Heart doth await.
    <br>It has awoken, but needs rest
    <br>No more you dare to make him wait!
    <br>One final chance to be his guest.
</p>
<p class="poem" id="poem34">#34
    <br>I thank you kindly, men of war!
    <br>Was tested thoroughly Wraithflame,
    <br>all flaws were noted, like before-
    <br> …will Father work now on his frame.
    <br>
    <br>He will be busy seven nights,
    <br>not one needs maintenance, but two.
    <br>Don't dare disrupt his candle's light,
    <br>When time has come, he'll let you through.
</p>
<p class="poem" id="poem35">#35 (sent to Raff)
    <br>Now you I did not see quite well.
    <br>Don't overthink, I hold no grudge.
    <br>Tomorrow Father'll weave his spell,
    <br>Please do attend and be his judge.

<h3 class="poemHeader">3 FEB 2018 - saturday</h3>
<p class="poem" id="poem36">#36 (sent to Kallah)
    <br>Unwaking he doth wander far,
    <br>The elder vagrant in deep slumber.
    <br>He's longing for the frigid star.
    <br>Find him, wake the ancient thunder.
</p>
<p class="poem" id="poem37">#37
    <br>Now this was so quite... unexpected.
    <br>The phantom ripple you did crush,
    <br>its fleeting soul by me collected,
    <br>was used on cripple in a rush.
</p>
<p class="poem" id="poem38">#38
    <br>What did awake the Broken soul?
    <br>What ancient mind new arm did rouse?
    <br>He may look waking, in control.
    <br>His mind, however, 's free of vows.
</p>
<p class="poem" id="poem39">#39
    <br>Flame and Abyss were angered, mad.
    <br>They fought the Father 'till the end.
    <br>The cripple though, at most just sad,
    <br>into nostalgia he was sent.
</p>
<p class="poem" id="poem40">#40
    <br>I often wonder in the dark.
    <br>When all my candles fade,
    <br>what's left of my unruly spark?
    <br>The Father's doll of highest grade?
</p>
<p class="poem" id="poem41">#41
    <br>The  elder  soul  doth  slumber  deep.
    <br>At  last,  you  cannot  do  a  thing.
    <br>He's  gone  too  far  in  endless  sleep.
    <br>There's  nothing  that  him  back  could  bring.
</p>
<p class="poem" id="poem42">#42
    <br>And ever more you try and fail,
    <br>Applaud in order, yet ever still,
    <br>he dreams of things so old and frail.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>...ah, wait, what's this, a morning chill?
</p>
<p class="poem" id="poem43">#43
    <br>There is despite this one more doll,
    <br>Unstable nature you did shake,
    <br>The starless night had to befall.
    <br>One hour more, it shall awake.
</p>
<p class="poem" id="poem44">#44
    <br>Two stitched, oh how they fought!
    <br>As one were purged, to isolation.
    <br>As one serene, withstood the rot.
    <br>One has emerged, free of frustration.
    <br>
    <br>It well remembers your blades' mark.
    <br>Why would you your aggression cease?
    <br>It found tranquility amidst the dark.
    <br>Go challenge its awakened peace.
</p>
<p class="poem" id="poem45">#45
    <br>Oh yes, indeed, no longer two persist:
    <br>Blood-crazed flame distilled by void.
    <br>It screamed and fought, 'till final twist.
    <br>Alas, its weak persona is destroyed.
    <br>?
</p>
<p class="poem" id="poem46">#46
    <br>What's there, beyond the Age of light?
    <br>Is there a greater good to come?
    <br>What comes afore the darkest night?
    <br>Perhaps it knows, this thing now done.
</p>

</p>
<p class="poem" id="poem48">#48
    <br>Have I achieved what I long sought?
    <br>Flame may be scratched, but is unbent.
    <br>Don't dare disturb the thing you fought.
    <br>It shall now vanish and repent.

    <br><i>Alone again I'm wandering in haze.

    <br>near draws the time when it is gone.
